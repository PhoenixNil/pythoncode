00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,060
at the technical problems identify
them and find the way to resolve

496
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,190
them and find the way to resolve
them

497
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,370
them and find the way to resolve
them so

498
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:25,700
them and find the way to resolve
them So this

499
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,720
them and find the way to resolve
them So this is

500
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:26,910
them and find the way to resolve
them So this is how

501
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,330
them and find the way to resolve
them So this is how you

502
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:27,810
them and find the way to resolve
them So this is how you learn about

503
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,400
them So this is how you learn about
your

504
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,620
them So this is how you learn about
your technique

505
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,810
them So this is how you learn about
your technique about

506
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,240
them So this is how you learn about
your technique about your

507
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,960
them So this is how you learn about
your technique about your hands

508
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,550
your technique about your hands
about your

509
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,470
your technique about your hands
about your ability

510
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,020
your technique about your hands
about your ability So

511
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,880
your technique about your hands
about your ability so everybody's

512
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,150
about your ability So everybody's
very

513
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,620
about your ability So everybody's
very individual So I

514
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,660
about your ability So everybody's
very individual so I can

515
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:35,980
about your ability So everybody's
very individual so I can you

516
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,190
about your ability So everybody's
very individual so I can

517
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,400
about your ability So everybody's
very individual so I can give

518
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,420
very individual So I can give advice
but I think

519
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,160
very individual So I can give advice
but I think we

520
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,720
very individual So I can give advice
but I think we ourselves

521
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,340
very individual So I can give advice
but I think we ourselves have to

522
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,830
but I think we ourselves have to
find

523
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,030
but I think we ourselves have to
find ways to

524
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,780
but I think we ourselves have to
find ways to make

525
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,860
find ways to make our technique
efficient.

526
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,320
efficient.
Enough to

527
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,630
efficient.
Enough to play

528
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,840
efficient.
Enough to play this

529
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,490
efficient.
Enough to play this piece or any

530

Enough to play this piece or any
other piece

531
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,350
Enough to play this piece or any
other piece scales

532
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,770
Enough to play this piece or any
other piece Scales are

533
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,500
other piece Scales are very very
important before

534

out you can do

616
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,660
finger If you need to push the elbow
out you can do that

617
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,090
finger If you need to push the elbow
out you can do that but try not

618
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,020
finger If you need to push the elbow
out you can do that but try not to

619
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,230
out you can do that but try not to
do

620
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,310
out you can do that but try not to
do this

but try not to do this or that,
so don't move your hand.

624
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,450
so don't move your hand.
So much to

625
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,940
so don't move your hand.
So much to the left or

626
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,360
so don't move your hand.
So much to the left or too much to

627
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,070
So much to the left or too much to
the right

628
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,980
So much to the left or too much to
the right Always

629
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,360
the right Always always straight
like

630
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,750
the right Always always straight
like this so

631
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,430
the right Always always straight
like this so for

632
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,760
the right. Always always straight.
This so for example scale.

633
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,140
Pay attention.

634
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,370
This

635
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,190
This is just

636
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,280
This is just a

637
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,590
This is just a simple

638
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,280
This is just a simple C major scale.

639
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,670
But

640
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,980
But again this

641
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,190
But again this is

642
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,740
But again this is how we learn

643
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,290
But again this is how we learn about

644
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,920
But again this is how we learn about
technique

645
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,290
But again this is how we learn about
technique Also pay

646
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,470
But again this is how we learn about
technique Also pay attention

647
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:02,660
But again this is how we learn about
technique Also pay attention to

648
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:02,850
But again this is how we learn about
technique Also pay attention to the

649
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,400
pay attention to the right hand as
well.

650
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,520
The same

651
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
The same with

652
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,540
The same with the right

653
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,260
The same with the right hand this

654
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,500
The same with the right hand This
should be straight

655
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,270
The same with the right hand This
should be straight not too

656
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,440
The same with the right hand This
should be straight not too much

657
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,910
should be straight not too much to
the right or

658
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,530
should be straight not too much to
the right or too much

659
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:10,690
should be straight not too much to
the right or too much to the left

660
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,000
should be straight not too much to
the right or too much to the left so

661

you want

676
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,350
first string up and down like this
you want to

677
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,610
first string up and down like this
you want to build

678
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,010
first string up and down like this
you want to build up your

679
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,190
first string up and down like this
You want to build up your technique

680
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,390
You want to build up your technique
you

681
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,870
You want to build up your technique
you don't want to learn

682
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,530
you don't want to learn without
working on

683
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,860
you don't want to learn without
working on your

684
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,790
you don't want to learn without
working on your technical

685
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,090
working on your technical ability
because the

686
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,300
working on your technical ability
because the mistakes

687
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,380
working on your technical ability
because the mistakes you

688
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,280
working on your technical ability
because the mistakes you make in the

689
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,550
because the mistakes you make in the
beginning

690
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,980
because the mistakes you make in the
beginning and if

691
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,170
because the mistakes you make in the
beginning and if you

692
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,660
because the mistakes you make in the
beginning and if you learn

693
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,330
beginning and if you learn the wrong
way

694
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,910
beginning and if you learn the wrong
way you have

695
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,220
beginning and if you learn the wrong
way you have to

696
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,920
beginning and if you learn the wrong
way you have to pay for it later

697
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,400
way you have to pay for it later So
I know

698
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,170
have to pay for it later. So I know
from my own experience.

699
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,770
from my own experience.
There's certain things

700
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,660
from my own experience.
There's certain things that

701
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,490
from my own experience.
There's certain things that I had to

702
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,020
There's certain things that I had to
fix over

703
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,550
There's certain things that I had to
fix over the years

704
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,040
There's certain things that I had to
fix over the years because

705
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,640
There's certain things that I had to
fix over the years because I've

706
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:40,950
fix over the years because I've
learned I've

707
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,630
fix over the years because I've
learned I've learned

708
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,340
learned I've learned it the wrong
way

709
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,940
learned I've learned it the wrong
way so it's very

710
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,950
learned I've learned it the wrong
way so it's very difficult

711
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,350
learned I've learned it the wrong
way so it's very difficult to

712
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,860
way so it's very difficult to fix
bad habits so

713
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,060
way So it's very difficult to fix
bad habits So it's

714
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,210
way So it's very difficult to fix
bad habits So it's always

715
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,550
way so it's very difficult to fix
bad habits So it's always good

716
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:47,930
way so it's very difficult to fix
bad habits So it's always good to do

717
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,430
bad habits So it's always good to do
it in

718
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,020
bad habits So it's always good to do
it in the beginning and

719
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
it in the beginning and learn the
proper

720
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,340
it in the beginning and learn the
proper way

721
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,800
it in the beginning and learn the
proper way I think

722
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,790
it in the beginning and learn the
proper way I think this

723
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,450
proper way I think this piece should
be practiced with

724
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:52,690
proper way I think this piece should
be practiced with the

725
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,730
proper way I think this piece should
be practiced with the metronome It's

726
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,100
be practiced with the metronome It's
very

727
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,500
be practiced with the metronome It's
very important

728
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,880
be practiced with the metronome It's
very important before

729
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,350
be practiced with the metronome It's
very important before you start

730
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,500
very important before you start
practicing

731
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,070
very important before you start
practicing it

732
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,840
very important before you start
practicing it and playing

733
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,090
very important before you start
practicing it and playing it

734
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,340
practicing it and playing it please
establish the

735
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,010
practicing it and playing it please
establish the tempo

736
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,450
practicing it and playing it please
establish the tempo that you

737
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,930
please establish the tempo that you
want to play it.

738
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,050
When you were practicing it you

739
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,510
When you were practicing it you
should

740
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,620
When you were practicing it you
should practice very very

741
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,110
When you were practicing it you
should practice very very very

742

should practice very very very
slowly So

744
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,760
should practice very very very
slowly So very very slowly

745
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,060
slowly So very very slowly Don't
play

746
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,940
slowly So very very slowly Don't
play it

747
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,350
slowly So very very slowly Don't
play it in tempo

748
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,700
slowly So very very slowly Don't
play it in tempo practice

749
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,000
slowly So very very slowly Don't
play it in tempo practice it very

750
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,540
play it in tempo practice it very
slow so it

751
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,140
practice it very slow,
so it could be.

752
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,250
Anything

753
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,620
Anything You

754
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,690
Anything you feel

755
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,920
Anything you feel comfortable

756
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Anything you feel comfortable I
would suggest perhaps.

757
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,610
Something.

758
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,700
Even

759
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,860
Even slower

760
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,130
Even slower than

761
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,600
Even slower than that

762
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,330
Even slower than that Very

763
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:26,700
Even slower than that very very slow
because

764
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,890
Even slower than that very very slow
because the

765
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,620
Even slower than that very very slow
because the tempo

766
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,750
Even slower than that very very slow
because the tempo that you

767
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,650
because the tempo that you
established in the beginning

768
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,180
established in the beginning will
kind

769
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,430
established in the beginning will
kind of

770
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,750
established in the beginning will
kind of have to be

771
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,620
established in the beginning will
kind of have to be there

772
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,810
established in the beginning will
kind of have to be there for

773
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,160
established in the beginning will
kind of have to be there for the

774
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,690
kind of have to be there for the
entire

775
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,490
kind of have to be there for the
entire asset

776
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,100
kind of have to be there for the
entire asset section so

777
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,260
kind of have to be there for the
entire asset section So don't

778
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,800
entire asset section so don't change
it

779
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,440
entire asset section So don't change
it when the

780
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,880
entire asset section So don't change
it when the difficult

781
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,740
entire asset section So don't change
it when the difficult part

782
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,020
it when the difficult part comes up
make

783
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,090
it when the difficult part comes up
Make sure that

784
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,580
it When the difficult part comes up
make sure that it's

785
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,050
make sure that it's always the same
tempo

786
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,160
make sure that it's always the same
tempo So

787
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,170
make sure that it's always the same
tempo So that's

788
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,320
make sure that it's always the same
tempo So that's why

789
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,750
make sure that it's always the same
tempo So that's why the

790
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,570
make sure that it's always the same
tempo So that's why the metronome is

791
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,870
tempo So that's why the metronome is
very important when

792
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,970
tempo So that's why the metronome is
very important when you're

793
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,040
tempo So that's why the metronome is
very important when you're in

794
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,380
tempo So that's why the metronome is
very important when you're in the

795
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,590
very important when you're in the
practicing part

796
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:46,970
very important when you're in the
practicing part of

797
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,490
very important when you're in the
practicing part of learning

798
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,340
practicing part of learning this
piece

799
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,390
practicing part of learning this
piece you shouldn't

800
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,710
practicing part of learning this
piece you shouldn't change the

801
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,710
piece you shouldn't change the
colors

802
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,570
piece you shouldn't change the
colors just play

803
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:50,780
piece you shouldn't change the
colors just play it straight

804
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,040
piece you shouldn't change the
colors just play it straight through

805
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,700
just play it straight through in one
one.

806
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,650
one.
Color

807
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:53,950
one.
Color dynamics

808
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,890
one.
Color dynamics come later that

809
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,500
one.
Color dynamics come later that we

810
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,760
Color dynamics come later that we
can

811
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,110
Color dynamics come later that we
can talk about

812
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,410
Color dynamics come later that we
can talk about later

813
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,430
Color dynamics come later that we
can talk about later but

814
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,540
Color dynamics come later that we
can talk about later but in

815
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,290
Color dynamics come later that we
can talk about later but in the

816
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,490
can talk about later but in the
beginning

817
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,850
can talk about later but in the
beginning stages

818
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,110
can talk about later but in the
beginning stages you should play

819
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,580
can talk about later but in the
beginning stages you should play it

820
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,920
beginning stages you should play it
just straight

821
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,810
just straight through It's important
to

822
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:02,840
just straight through It's important
to practice

823
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,510
just straight through It's important
to practice this piece by

824
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:05,660
just straight through It's important
to practice this piece by sections

825
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,180
to practice this piece by sections
So we're

826
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,250
to practice this piece by sections
so we're going to

827
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,730
to practice this piece by sections
so we're going to talk

828
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,380
to practice this piece by sections
So we're going to talk about the

829
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,610
so we're going to talk about the
measure

830
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:08,980
So we're going to talk about the
measure numbers and I'm

831
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,080
So we're going to talk about the
measure numbers and I'm going

832
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,470
measure numbers and I'm going to
kind

833
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,790
measure numbers and I'm going to
kind of lead

834
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,230
measure numbers and I'm going to
kind of lead you

835
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,560
measure numbers and I'm going to
kind of lead you through

836
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,290
measure numbers and I'm going to
kind of lead you through it but

837
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,510
kind of lead you through it but
again

838
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,840
kind of lead you through it but
again don't

839
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,850
lead you through it. But again,
don't play the A section.

840
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,810
don't play the A section.
Through

841
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,260
don't play the A section.
Through just

842
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,910
don't play the A section.
Through just play in

843
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,010
don't play the A section.
Through just play in sections

844
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,170
don't play the A section.
Through just play in sections so

845
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,880
Through just play in sections so
that's

846
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,060
Through just play in sections So
that's very

847
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,700
Through just play in sections,
so that's very important as well and.

848
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,560
If you

849
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,380
If you choose a

850
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,160
If you choose a transcription

851
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,640
If you choose a transcription that

852
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,990
If you choose a transcription that
already

853
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,310
If you choose a transcription that
already has the

854
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,460
If you choose a transcription that
already has the fingerings

855
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:29,930
already has the fingerings in it you
can

856
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,430
already has the fingerings in it you
can of

857
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,470
already has the fingerings in it you
can of course use

858
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,720
already has the fingerings in it you
can of course use those

859
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,200
already has the fingerings in it you
can of course use those fingerings

860
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,460
can of course use those fingerings
but

861
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,840
can of course use those fingerings
but if something

862
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,130
can of course use those fingerings
But if something is

technical ability comes in and.
That's how we

912
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,800
technical ability comes in and.
That's how we learn what works

913
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,120
technical ability comes in and.
That's how we learn what works for

914
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,500
That's how we learn what works for
us

915
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,550
That's how we learn what works for
us and

916
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,080
That's how we learn what works for
us and what doesn't work

917
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,350
That's how we learn what works for
us and what doesn't work So again

918
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,720
us and what doesn't work So again
you

919
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
us and what doesn't work So again
you don't have

920

00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,030
you don't have to follow exactly
what's in the

922
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,360
you don't have to follow exactly
what's in the transcription

923
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
you don't have to follow exactly
what's in the transcription The

O we have in the beginning we have a
bar a bars measures from

994
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,810
O we have in the beginning we have a
bar A bars measures from one to

995
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,930
O we have in the beginning we have a
bar A bars measures from 1 to 16

996
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,090
bar A bars measures from 1 to 16
There's

997
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,300
bar A bars measures from 1 to 16
There's several

998
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,780
bar A bars measures from 1 to 16
There's several decisions

999
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,640
bar A bars measures from 1 to 16
There's several decisions you should

1000
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,230
There's several decisions you should
make here about

1001
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,600
There's several decisions you should
make here about the

1002
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,330
There's several decisions you should
make here about the right

1003
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,830
There's several decisions you should
make here about the right hand

1004
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,500
make here about the right hand for
example

1005
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,960
make here about the right hand for
example so you can

1006
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,820
make here about the right hand for
example so you can play

1007
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,490
make here about the right hand for
example so you can play this

1008
00:10:59,490 --> 00:10:59,660
make here about the right hand for
example so you can play this section

1009
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,940
example so you can play this section
PM

1010
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,670
example so you can play this section
PM PPI or PII PII so

1011
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,970
example So you can play this section
PM PPI or PII PII So it's

1012
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,800
PM PPI or PII PII So it's completely
up

1013
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,370
PM PPI or PII PII So it's completely
up to

1014
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:03,780
PM PPI or PII PII So it's completely
up to you

1015
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,890
section PM PSI or PSI PSI. So it's
completely up to you. I use PMP I.

1016
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,160
completely up to you. I use PMP I.
So for example.

1017
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,110
So

1018
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,170
So it's PMI.

1019
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,980
O

1020
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,570
OI

1021
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,000
OI just

1022
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,100
OI just alternate

1023
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,330
OI just alternate if

1024
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,040
OI just alternate if you

1025
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,670
OI just alternate if you want

1026
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,200
OI just alternate if you want to use

1027
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,440
So I just alternate if you want to
use that's fine too.

1028
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,250
You

1029
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:26,450
You can

1030
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:26,920
You can experiment

1031
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,260
You can experiment and

1032
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,510
You can experiment and see what

1033

this is a easy section right This is
just the introduction

1047
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,650
this is a easy section right This is
just the introduction to the piece

1048
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,130
just the introduction to the piece
but

1049
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,150
just the introduction to the piece
but there are

1050
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,500
just the introduction to the piece
but there are several

1051
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,820
just the introduction to the piece
but there are several things that

1052
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,030
but there are several things that
you

1053
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,100
but there are several things that

you should think about for example
with the

1056
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:41,940
you should think about for example
with the left

1057

you should think about For example
with the left hand make sure again

1059
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,370
with the left hand make sure again
like

1060
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:43,620
with the left hand make sure again
like we

1061
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,470
with the left hand make sure again
like we said in the beginning

1062
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,910
like we said in the beginning make
sure

1063

Also it's important to practice with
the very independent fingers

1096
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,460
Also it's important to practice with
the very independent fingers make

1097
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,090
very independent fingers. Make sure
that each finger.

1098
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,850
Press

1099
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,530

Don't connect it

1104
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,600
Don't connect it like

1105
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,140
Don't connect it like this

1106
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,890
Don't connect it like this For
example let's

1107
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,470
Don't connect it like this for
example Let's not always

1108
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,140
Don't connect it like this for
example let's not always good so

1109
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,260
example let's not always good so
make

1110
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,620
listen. That's not always good,
so make sure that you do.

1111
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,740
Always

1112
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,960
Always you Always

1113
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,070
Always You always lift

1114
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,580
Always You always lift the

1115
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,790
Always You always lift the previous

1116
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,200
Always You always lift the previous
finger before

1117
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,110
Always You always lift the previous
finger before you

1118
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,460
Always You always lift the previous
finger before you press

1119
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,330
finger before you press with the
next finger This

1120
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,950
finger before you press with the
next finger This is

1121
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,020
finger before you press with the
next finger This is how you teach

1122
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,530
next finger This is how you teach
the

1123
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,290
next finger This is how you teach
the independence of your

1124

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,270
it's just a good technical exercise
So what you can also do with this

1131
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,780
So what you can also do with this
section the first section

1132
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:36,870
So what you can also do with this
section the first section from

1133
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,300
section the first section from one
to

1134
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,770
section the first section from 1 to
16

1135
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,170
section the first section from 1 to
16 is you

1136
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,480
section the first section from 1 to
16 is you can

1137
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,720
section the first section from 1 to
16 is you can accent the

1138
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:39,860
section the first section from 1 to
16 is you can accent the 1st

1139
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,260
you can accent the first bit a
little bit.

1140
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,990
Not too much.

1141
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,230
So

1142
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,490
So it's

1143
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,510
So it's U to

1144
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,900
So it's U to you Another thing

that will follow throughout the
entire section

1184
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,720
that will follow throughout the
entire section through

1185
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,560
that will follow throughout the
entire section through the

that will follow throughout the
entire section through the entire

1187
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,910
that will follow throughout the
entire section through the entire A

1188
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,260
entire section through the entire A
section you

1189
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,260

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,220
melody in this a section So try to
focus on that and make this line

1235
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,550

visible in

1236
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,450

the sections that you're going to be
practicing dynamically

1245
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,370
the sections that you're going to be
practicing dynamically you can

1246
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,810
practicing dynamically you can do
little crescendo and

1247
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,500
dynamically. You can do a little
crescendo and decrescendo here.

1248
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,050
crescendo and decrescendo here.

have some sort

1263

but that's kind of an idea just to
have some sort of direction

1264
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,720
but that's kind of an idea just to
have some sort of direction Try

1265
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:42,970
but that's kind of an idea Just to
have some sort of direction Try not

have some sort of direction Try not
to

1267
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,390
have some sort of direction. Try not

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,810
To follow throughout the first the
complete first section so

1319
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,360
To follow throughout the first the
complete first section so next

1320
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,450
To follow throughout the first the
complete first section So next we

1321
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:20,660
complete first section So next we
have

1322
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,340
complete first section So next we
have a bar

1323
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,000
complete first section So next we
have a bar 16th

1324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,520
complete first section So next we
have a bar 16th and

1325
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:22,790
complete first section So next we
have a bar 16th and 17th

1326
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,980
complete first section so next we
have a bar 16th and 17th so

1327
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,370
complete first section So next we
have a bar 16th and 17th So this is

1328
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:23,710
have a bar 16th and 17th So this is
where it starts

1329
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,240
have a bar 16th and 17th So this is
where it starts to

1330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,850
have a bar 16th and 17th So this is
where it starts to get a little

1331
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:24,940
where it starts to get a little
interesting and

1332
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,340
where it starts to get a little
interesting and a

1333
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,670
where it starts to get a little
interesting and a little

1334
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,460
where it starts to get a little
interesting and a little technically

1335
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,950
interesting and a little technically
more

1336
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,290
interesting and a little technically
more challenging

1337
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,810
interesting and a little technically
more challenging in

1338
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,260
more challenging in this section
from bar

1339
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,680
more challenging in this section
from Bar 16 to

1340
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,380
more challenging in this section
from Bar 16 to 17

1341
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,520
more challenging in this section
from Bar 16 to 17 there

1342
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,190
more challenging In this section
from Bar 16 to 17 there should

1343
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,950
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little

1344
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,160
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little crescendo

1345
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,940
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little crescendo just

1346
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,320
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little crescendo just so

1347
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,480
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little crescendo just so that

1348
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,040
from Bar 16 to 17 there should be a
little crescendo just so that you

1349
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,490
little crescendo just so that you
land

1350
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,460
little crescendo just so that you
land on this octave

1351
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,930
little crescendo just so that you
land on this octave on in

1352
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,290
little crescendo just so that you
land on this octave on in the

1353
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,950
land on this octave on in the bar in
the

1354
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,170
land on this octave on in the bar in
the measure

1355
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,800
land on this octave on in the bar in
the measure 17th

1356
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,890
land on this octave on in the bar in
the measure 17th on

1357
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,390
land on this octave on in the bar in
the measure 17th on time and we

1358
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,770
land on this octave on in the bar in
the measure 17th on time and we have

1359
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:39,920
the measure 17th on time and we have
to

1360
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,310
the measure 17th on time and we have
to hear

1361
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,150
the measure 17th on time and we have
to hear that

1362
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,580
the measure 17th on time and we have
to hear that octave

1363
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:41,840
to hear that octave very clearly So
also what

1364
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,390
to hear that octave very clearly So
also what is

1365
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,660
to hear that octave very clearly So
also what is important

1366
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,150
to hear that octave very clearly So
also what is important is not

1367
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,360
also what is important is not to
take

1368
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,620
also what is important is not to
take too

1369
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,070
also what is important is not to
take too much of a break.

1370
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,960
take too much of a break.
Between

1371
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,380
take too much of a break.
Between the

1372
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,530
take too much of a break.
Between the bar 16 and

1373
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,740
take too much of a break.
Between the bar 16 and 17th So try

1374
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,440
Between the bar 16 and 17th So try
to land

1375
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,300
Between the bar 16 and 17th so try
to land there on

1376
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,590
Between the bar 16 and 17th so try
to land there on time

1377
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,790
Between the bar 16 and 17th so try
to land there on time so

1378
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,140
Between the bar 16 and 17th So try
to land there on time so that you

1379
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,980
to land there on time so that you
don't make

1380
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,220
to land there on time so that you
don't make a

1381
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,610
to land there on time so that you
don't make a make

1382
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,950
to land there on time so that you
don't make a make a break in between.

1383
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,420
So and then

1384
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,960
So and then this

1385
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,250
So and then this is

1386
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,080
So and then This is very important

1387
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,900
So and then This is very important
to

1388
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,870
So and then this is very important
to hear

1389
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,170
So and then this is very important
to hear very clearly and

1390
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,400
So and then this is very important
to hear very clearly and it

1391
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,890
to hear very clearly and it should
be

1392
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,570
to hear very clearly and it should
be it's advisable to

1393
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:04,750
to hear very clearly and it should
be it's advisable to play together I

1394
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,140
be it's advisable to play together I
know

1395
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,650
be it's advisable to play together I
know there's

1396
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,580
be it's advisable to play together I
know there's sometimes

1397
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,190
be it's advisable to play together I
know there's sometimes sometimes

1398
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,900
know there's sometimes sometimes
people play separately

1399
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,630
know there's sometimes sometimes
people play separately but I think

1400
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,150
people play separately but I think
it's better if

1401
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,610
people play separately but I think
it's better if you

1402
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,210
people play separately but I think
it's better if you just

1403
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,830
it's better if you just play
together

1404
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:11,990
it's better if you just play
together because it's

1405
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,540
together because it's stronger and
kind

1406
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,650
together because it's stronger and
kind of

1407
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,050
together because it's stronger and
kind of the sound has

1408
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,640
together because it's stronger and
kind of the sound has a

1409
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,310
together because it's stronger and
kind of the sound has a little

1410
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,560
together because it's stronger and
kind of the sound has a little bit

1411
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,930
kind of the sound has a little bit
more

1412
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,410
kind of the sound has a little bit
more presence

1413
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:18,990
kind of the sound has a little bit
more presence so

1414
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,620
kind of the sound has a little bit
more presence So this section

1415
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:19,740
kind of the sound has a little bit
more presence So this section is

1416
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,020
more presence So this section is
quite

1417
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,690
more presence So this section is
quite challenging

1418
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,250
more presence So this section is
quite challenging there's

1419
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,690
quite challenging there's several
technical

1420
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,410
quite challenging There's several
technical issues

1421
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,630
quite challenging There's several
technical issues here and

1422
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:24,860
technical issues here and so the
right

1423
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,400
several technical issues here and so
the right hand.

1424
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,220
the right hand.
Again

1425
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,550
the right hand.
Again you can

1426
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,690

1434
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,550
Again you can choose how you want to
play This is up to you I use the

1435
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:33,850
play This is up to you I use the
thumb

1436
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,830

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,580
play This is up to you I use the
thumb for both for both

1440
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,810
for both for both strings for the
octave.

1441
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,150
You

1442
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,550
You can

1443
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,150
You can also

1444
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,520
You can also play

1445
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,810
You can also play it with

1446
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,010
You can also play it with P and I

1447
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,580
You can also play it with P and I
wouldn't necessarily

1448
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,600
You can also play it with P and I
wouldn't necessarily suggest that

1449
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,910
wouldn't necessarily suggest that
it's

1450
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,600
wouldn't necessarily suggest that
it's quite challenging

1451
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:47,940
wouldn't necessarily suggest that
it's quite challenging and difficult

1452
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,090
it's quite challenging and difficult
because

1453
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,200
it's quite challenging and difficult
because you

1454
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,840
it's quite challenging and difficult
because you still

1455
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,180
it's quite challenging and difficult
because you still have to go here.

1456
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,690
I

1457
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,010
I mean you could

1458
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,500
I mean you could do it

1459
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:53,810
I mean you could do it you

1460
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,000
I mean you could do it You could try

1461
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,860
I mean you could do it you could try
it

1462
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,290
I mean you could do it you could try
it but I

1463
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,030
I mean you could do it you could try
it but I think this is

1464
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,160
I mean you could do it you could try
it but I think this is better

1465
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,320
it but I think this is better just
to

1466
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,590
it but I think this is better just
to play

1467
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,710
but I think this is better just to
play with the thumb.

1468
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,580
play with the thumb.
And

1469
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,750
play with the thumb.
And I

1470
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,240
play with the thumb.
And I don't know if any other

1471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,860
play with the thumb.
And I don't know if any other ways

1472
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,370
And I don't know if any other ways
but

1473
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,600
And I don't know if any other ways
but again

1474
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:01,890
And I don't know if any other ways
but again you can

1475
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,040
And I don't know if any other ways
but again you can experiment

1476
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,490
And I don't know if any other ways
but again you can experiment and you

1477
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:02,530
but again you can experiment and you
can see

1478
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,590
but again you can experiment and you
can see what

1479
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,110
but again you can experiment and you
can see what works

1480
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,370
but again you can experiment and you
can see what works for you

1481
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,190
can see what works for you Perhaps
you

1482
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,340
can see what works for Perhaps you
can

1483
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,740
can see what works for Perhaps you
can find another

1484
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,080
can see what works for you can find
another way

1485
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,590
can see what works for you can find
another way to

1486
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,700
can see what works for you can find
another way to play

1487
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,070
can see what works for you can find
another way to play this

17th is to land on time Make sure we
hear the octave

1502
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,870
17th is to land on time Make sure we
hear the octave very clearly

1503
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,180
17th is to land on time make sure we
hear the octave very clearly and

1504
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,990
hear the octave very clearly and
together OK we have

1505
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,340
hear the octave very clearly and
together OK we have here

1506
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,920
together OK we have here the
arpeggios

1507
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,310
together OK we have here arpeggios
the

1508
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,260
together OK we have here the
arpeggios the triplets so

1509
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,740
together OK we have here the
arpeggios the triplets so this

1510
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,900
arpeggios the triplets So this is
where it gets interesting

1511
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,010
arpeggios the triplets So this is
where it gets interesting So

1512
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,210
arpeggios the triplets So this is
where it gets interesting So you're

1513
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,700
gets interesting. So you're going to
have this.

1514
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,980
And then

1515
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,240
And then you're

1516
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,590
And then you're gonna have triplets.

1517
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,830
It's

1518
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,950
It's very important

It's very important to play these
triplets

1523
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,660
It's very important to play these
triplets very

1524
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:35,810
It's very important to play these
triplets very well

1525
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,250
It's very important to play these
triplets very well articulated we

1526
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,570
triplets very well articulated We
have to

1527
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:36,900
triplets very well articulated We
have to hear them of

1528
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,850
triplets very well articulated We
have to hear them of course the

1529
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,060
have to hear them of course the
baseline

1530
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,390
have to hear them of course the
baseline and

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,800
the baseline and the melodies still
important.

1534
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,310
But

1535
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,780
But the triplets

1536
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,290
But the triplets are very important
to

1537
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,450
But the triplets are very important
to be

1538
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,120
But the triplets are very important
to be very very

1539
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,700
But the triplets are very important
to be very very well

1540
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:51,760
But the triplets are very important
to be very very well articulated So

1541
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,730
to be very very well articulated So
again practicing

1542
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:53,860
to be very very well articulated So
again practicing very

1543
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,380
again practicing very very slowly
with

1544
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,110
again practicing very very slowly
with the

1545
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,500
again practicing very very slowly
with the metronome

1546
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,280
again practicing very very slowly
with the metronome make

1547
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,670
again practicing very very slowly
with the metronome make sure that

finger presses very independently
and

1595
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,800
finger presses very independently
And you

1596
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,390
finger presses very independently
and you always

1597
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,130
finger presses very independently
and you always lift

1598
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,830
finger presses very independently
and you always lift the

1599
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,020
finger presses very independently
and you always lift the previous

1600

press with the next finger.

1604
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,590
press with the next finger.
It

1605
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,150
press with the next finger.
It is also helpful

1606
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,820

ahead and kind of anticipate where
the next finger

1615
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,010
ahead and kind of anticipate where
the next finger is going to press.

1616
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,800
the next finger is going to press.
So

1617
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:05,960
the next finger is going to press.
So this

1618
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,530
the next finger is going to press.
So this is

that I forgot to say in the
beginning when I was

1666
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,330
that I forgot to say in the
beginning when I was introducing

1667
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,440
beginning when I was introducing
these species that

1668
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,690
beginning when I was introducing
these species that there's always

1669
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,060
beginning when I was introducing
these species that there's always a

1670
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,530
these species that there's always a
connection

1671
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:35,680
these species that there's always a
connection between

1672
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,120
these species that there's always a
connection between the

1673
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,220
these species that there's always a
connection between the mind and

1674
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,960
these species that there's always a
connection between the mind and the

1675
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,150
connection between the mind and the
fingers so our

1676
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,390
connection between the mind and the
fingers So our fingers

1677
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,380
connection between the mind and the
fingers so our fingers always

1678
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,610
connection between the mind and the
fingers so our fingers always do

1679
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,580
fingers So our fingers always do
what our mind

1680
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,710
fingers so our fingers always do
what our mind tells

1681
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,220
fingers so our fingers always do
what our mind tells them to do

1682
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,750
what our mind tells them to do and
it's

1683
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,450
what our mind tells them to do And
it's really

1684
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:43,600
what our mind tells them to do and
it's really important to

1685
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,020
what our mind tells them to do and
it's really important to have

1686
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,630
what our mind tells them to do and
it's really important to have that

1687
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,780
it's really important to have that
connection because the

1688
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,350
it's really important to have that
connection because the hands

1689
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,530
connection because the hands
sometimes

1690
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:48,740
connection because the hands
sometimes do whatever

1691
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,220
connection because the hands
sometimes do whatever they

1692
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,550
sometimes do whatever they want to
do so.

1693
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,280
do so.
That's just the nature.

Of the beast so we

1698
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,270
That's just the nature.
Of the beast so we have

1699
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,420
That's just the nature.
Of the beast so we have to

1700
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,750
That's just the nature.
Of the beast so we have to tell the

1701
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,960
Of the beast so we have to tell the
fingers

1702
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,190
Of the beast so we have to tell the
fingers what

1703
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,320
Of the beast so we have to tell the
fingers what to

1704
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,710
Of the beast so we have to tell the
fingers what to do

1705
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,880
Of the beast So we have to tell the
fingers what to do because

1706
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,150
Of the beast So we have to tell the
fingers what to do because if

1707
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,420
fingers what to do because if we
don't

1708
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:58,680
fingers what to do because there's
not

1709
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,040
fingers what to do because there's
not much

1710
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
fingers what to do because don't
there's not much control

1711
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,220
fingers what to do because don't
there's not much control there

1712
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,610
there's not much control there So
this is

1713
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,220
There's not much control there So

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,940
that is very important here in this
section is to have no tension in the

1828
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,230
section is to have no tension in the
left hand

1829
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,390
section is to have no tension in the
left hand So

1830
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,830
section is to have no tension in the
left hand so sometimes

1831
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,270
section is to have no tension in the
left hand So sometimes when we

1832
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,570
left hand So sometimes when we have
difficult

1833
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:17,890
left hand So sometimes when we have
difficult sections

1834
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,400
left hand So sometimes when we have
difficult sections in

1835
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,210
left hand So sometimes when we have
difficult sections in the pieces

1836
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:19,890
difficult sections in the pieces
difficult

1837
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,260
difficult sections in the pieces
difficult technical

1838
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,510
difficult sections in the pieces
difficult technical sections we

1839
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,750
difficult sections in the pieces
difficult technical sections we tend

1840
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,020
difficult technical sections we tend
to grab

1841
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,930
difficult technical sections we tend
to grab the neck

1842
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,270
difficult technical sections we tend
to grab the neck of

1843
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,540
difficult technical sections we tend
to grab the neck of the

1844
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,400
to grab the neck of the guitar a
little

1845
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,810
to grab the neck of the guitar a
little too

1846
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,890
to grab the neck of the guitar a
little too with

1847
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,540
to grab the neck of the guitar a
little too with too much

1848
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,950
to grab the neck of the guitar a
little too with too much pressure So

1849
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,030
little too with too much pressure So
I

1850
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,070
little too with too much pressure So
I think it's

1851
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,840
pressure. So I think it's a
psychological.

1852
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,480
psychological.
I think because we

1853
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,990
psychological.
I think because we think that

1854
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,270
psychological.
I think because we think that we

1855
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,390
I think because we think that we
have

1856
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,740
I think because we think that we
have to do

1857
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:31,930
I think because we think that we
have to do it

1858
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,410
I think because we think that we
have to do it in order to

1859
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,910
I think because we think that we
have to do it in order to get

1860
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,180
have to do it in order to get
through

1861
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,920
have to do it in order to get
through this

1862
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,230
have to do it in order to get
through this section but it's

1863
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,660
have to do it in order to get
through this section but it's the

1864
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,160
through this section but it's the
complete

1865
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,440
through this section but it's the
complete opposite so

1866
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,800
through this section but it's the
complete opposite So when

1867
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,100
through this section but it's the
complete opposite So when you

1868
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,310
through this section but it's the
complete opposite So when you have

1869
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,670
through this section but it's the
complete opposite So when you have a

1870
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:37,910
complete opposite so when you have a
difficult section

1871
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,290
complete opposite So when you have a
difficult section you have

1872
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,230
complete opposite So when you have a
difficult section you have to

1873
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,860
difficult section you have to relax
because

1874
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,110
difficult section you have to relax
because it's

1875
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,310
difficult section you have to relax
because it's extremely

1876
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,490
difficult section you have to relax
because it's extremely difficult

1877
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:41,770
difficult section you have to relax
because it's extremely difficult to

1878
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:41,950
because it's extremely difficult to
get

1879
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,370
because it's extremely difficult to
get through

1880
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:42,800
because it's extremely difficult to
get through this section

1881
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,240
because it's extremely difficult to
get through this section with

1882
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,820
extremely difficult to get through
this section with the tense hand so.

1883
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,840
Make sure

1884
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,680

tension as possible because this is

1905
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,130

also

1906
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,900

tension as possible because this is
also way the way to

1910
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,140
tension as possible because this is
also way the way to preserve

1911
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,640
also way the way to preserve the
energy for the

1912
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,270
also way the way to preserve the
energy for the rest

1913
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,740
also way the way to preserve the
energy for the rest of the

1914
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:02,860
energy for the rest of the piece
because there's

1915
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,220
energy for the rest of the piece
because there's some

1916
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,800
energy for the rest of the piece
because there's some really

1917
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,310
because there's some really
difficult sections that are

This measure is also important to
have

2075
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,610
This measure is also important to
have a little crescendo towards

2076
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,470
have a little crescendo towards
discord

2077
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,680
have a little crescendo towards
discord as

2078
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,190

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,210
discord as you go through these
sections

2082
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,470
discord as you go through these
sections you

2083
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,910
discord as you go through these
sections you can

2084
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,850
discord as you go through these
sections you can get

2085
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,390
discord As you go through these
sections you can get a little louder

2086
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,860
sections you can get a little louder
in

2087
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,040
sections you can get a little louder
in each of

2088
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,150
sections You can get a little louder
in each of these

2089
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,580
sections You can get a little louder
in each of these sections so by

2090
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:35,720
sections You can get a little louder
in each of these sections So by the

2091
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,040
in each of these sections so by the
time

2092
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,520
in each of these sections so by the
time you

2093

to do this. Just make sure you kind
of dig into every.

2148
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,280
of dig into every.
Single string so

2149
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,840
of dig into every.
Single string so that we hear

2150
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,180
Single string so that we hear all
the notes in

2151
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,110
Single string so that we hear all
the notes in the

2152
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,840
Single string so that we hear all
the notes in the chord

2153
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
the notes in the chord and again
make sure

2154
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,020
the notes in the chord and again
make sure there's

2155

make sure there's no break in

2157
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,870
make sure there's no break in
between those bars

2158
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,470

Very clearly and with no breaks it's
kind of just kind of leaning to the

2168
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,870
kind of just kind of leaning to the
cord

2169
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,450
kind of just kind of leaning to the
cord and a little crescendo

2170
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,510
kind of just kind of leaning to the
cord and a little crescendo is

2171
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,800
cord and a little crescendo is
always

2172
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,230
cord and a little crescendo is
always good and

2173
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,510
cord and a little crescendo is
always good and for

2174
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,710
cord and a little crescendo is
always good and for example this

2175
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,190
cord and a little crescendo is
always good And for example this is

2176
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,360
always good. And for example,
this is I'm going to demonstrate.

2177
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,420
Of course he's

2178
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:35,520
Of course he's going to

2179
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,040
Of course he's going to take

2180
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,170
Of course he's going to take you

2181
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,970
Of course he's going to take a
second

2182
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,100
Of course he's going to take a
second to

2183
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,880
Of course he's going to take a
second to change

2184
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,480
Of course he's going to take a
second to change the

2185
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,730
Of course he's going to take a
second to change the *********

2186
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,460
second to change the ********* and
to shift

2187
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,890
second to change the ********* and
to shift but that's

2188
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,160
second to change the ********* and
to shift but that's just

2189
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,370
second to change the ********* and
to shift but that's just a second of

2190
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,940
to shift but that's just a second of
time

2191
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,090
to shift but that's just a second of
time make

2192
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,370
to shift but that's just a second of
time Make sure

2193
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:42,830
to shift but that's just a second of
time Make sure you don't

2194
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,140
to shift but that's just a second of
time Make sure you don't do too

2195
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,390
to shift but that's just a second of
time Make sure you don't do too much

2196
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,860
time Make sure you don't do too much
of

2197
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,240
Make sure you don't do too much of a
break, for example.

2198
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,460
It's too much

2199
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,740
It's too much so

2200
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:50,960
It's too much so this is just

2201
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,260
It's too much so this is just
something

2202
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,060

a little bit of a tricky transition
from guard

2211
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,000
a little bit of a tricky transition
from guard 20

2212
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,200
a little bit of a tricky transition
from guard 24 to

2215
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,520
a little bit of a tricky transition
from guard 24 to 25 because you

Move with the first finger

2221
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,950
Move with the first finger into the
bar.

2222
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,910
It's

2223
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,100
It's important again to

2224
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,250
It's important again to practice

2225
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,430
It's important again to practice it

2226
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,880
It's important again to practice it
very slowly

2227
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,190
It's important again to practice it
very slowly and

2228
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,630
very slowly and making making sure
that

2229
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,360
very slowly and making making sure
that transition

2230
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,710
very slowly and making making sure
that transition from the 1st

2231
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,890
that transition from the first
finger

2232
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,170
that transition from the first

00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,140
that transition from the first
finger going into

2234
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,780
that transition from the first
finger going into the

2235

that transition from the first
finger going into the bar

2236
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,170
that transition from the first
finger going into the bar is

2237
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,580
finger going into the bar is
prepared

2238
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:18,740
finger going into the bar is
prepared so

2239
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,280
finger going into the bar is
prepared so that

2240

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,540
So while you are here you should
already

2250
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,000
you should already prepare in the
bar.

2251

we're practicing this very very
slowly and

2268
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,130
we're practicing this very very
slowly and making

2269
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,580
we're practicing this very very
slowly and making sure again

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,420
doing So and then we're in the bar
25 to 30 this is

2285
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,780
doing So and then we're in the bar
25 to 30 this is a

2286
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,080
doing So and then we're in the bar
25 to 30 This is a really

2287
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,380
25 to 30 This is a really
interesting section

2288
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,740
25 to 30 This is a really
interesting section 20

2289
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,780
bar 25 to 30. This is a really
interesting section, 25 to 32.

2290
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,970
Here again the

2291
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,310
Here again the first chord.

2292
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,020
Not too

2293
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,400
Not too harsh

2294
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,850
Not too harsh there's

2295
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,220
Not too harsh There's several ways

2296
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,620
Not too harsh There's several ways
you can play

2297
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,490
Not too harsh There's several ways
you can play these

2298
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,300
Not too harsh There's several ways
you can play these Actually two ways

2299
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,330
you can play these Actually two ways
maybe 2

2300
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,750

maybe two or three ways

2303
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,010
you can play these Actually two ways
Maybe two or three ways But you

2304
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,800
you can play these Actually two ways
maybe two or three ways But you can

maybe two or three ways But you can
hear you can play rasgado

2309
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,000
hear you can play rasgado if you
would

2310
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,090
hear you can play rasgado if you
would like

2311
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,450
hear you can play rasgado if you
would like it's

2312
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:09,930

hear you can play rasgado if you
would like It's really completely up

2315
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,070
would like It's really completely up
to

2316
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,510
would like It's really completely up
to you

2317
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,720

would like It's really completely up
to you what kind

2330
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:16,980
and what kind of sound you would
like to produce with this action I'm

2331
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,050
like to produce with this action I'm
very very

2332
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,450
like to produce with this action I'm
very very bad with

2333
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,070
like to produce with this action I'm
very very bad with Resguardo

2334
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,360
like to produce with this action I'm
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm

2335
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,070
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm
not

2336
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,280
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm
not even

2337
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,340
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm
not even going

2338
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,770
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm
not even going to demonstrate

2339
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,290
very very bad with Resguardo so I'm
not even going to demonstrate this

2340
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,710
not even going to demonstrate this
is

2341
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,300
so I'm not even going to demonstrate
this is it's a disaster. So.

2342
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,290
But obviously there is

2343
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,910
But obviously there is Gato is
played

2344
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,440
But obviously there is Gato is
played with

2345
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,680
But obviously there is Gato is
played with AMI

2346
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:27,990
But obviously there is Gato is
played with AMI And if you do

2347
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,460
played with AMI and if you do the
rasgueado technique with

2348
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,820
played with AMI and if you do the
rasgueado technique with the

2349
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,370
rasgueado technique with the cord
make

2350
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:30,840
rasgueado technique with the cord
make sure

2351
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,030
rasgueado technique with the cord
make sure that

2352
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,890
rasgueado technique with the cord
make sure that it's

2353
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,260
rasgueado technique with the cord
make sure that it's again very

2354
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,850
make sure that it's again very
articulated that

2355
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,160
make sure that it's again very
articulated that we

2356
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,550
make sure that it's again very
articulated that we hear all

2357
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:33,690
make sure that it's again very
articulated that we hear all the

2358
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:33,980
articulated that we hear all the
notes in

2359
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,200
articulated that we hear all the
notes in the

2360
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,180
articulated that we hear all the
notes in the cord.

2361
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,140
notes in the cord.
Very clearly.

2362
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,510
Some people

2363
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,940
Some people are

2364
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,430
Some people are very much prone to

2365
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,830
Some people are very much prone to
it

2366
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,280
Some people are very much prone to
it and have

2367
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,300
Some people are very much prone to
it and have a

2368
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,510
Some people are very much prone to
it and have a natural

2369
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,000
Some people are very much prone to
it and have a natural ability

2370
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,450
Some people are very much prone to
it and have a natural ability and

2371
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:43,900
it and have a natural ability and
technical ability to do

2372
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,270
it and have a natural ability and
technical ability to do the

2373
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,280
technical ability to do the
regulator so by all means do it

2374
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,470
technical ability to do the
regulator So by all means do it if

2375
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,740
regulator So by all means do it if
you'd

2376
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,270
regulator so by all means do it if
you'd like

2377
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:48,560
regulator so by all means do it if
you'd like to

2378
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,490
regulator so by all means do it if
you'd like to But my suggestion is

2379
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:49,640
you'd like to but my suggestion is
something

2380
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,700
you'd like to but my suggestion is
something that

2381
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,140
you'd like to but my suggestion is
something that I do is

2382
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,370
you'd like to but my suggestion is
something that I do is just play

2383
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,910
something that I do is just play
with

2384
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,470
something that I do is just play
with eye fingers

2385
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,940
something that I do is just play
with eye fingers so I just

2386
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,680
with eye fingers So I just go like
this and

2387
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:54,840
with eye fingers So I just go like
this and I

2388
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:54,990
with eye fingers So I just go like
this and I don't know

2389
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,070
with eye fingers So I just go like
this and I don't know I find it

2390
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,190
with eye fingers So I just go like
this and I don't know I find it the

2391
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,580
this and I don't know I find it the
most

2392
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,680
this and I don't know I find it the
most articulated

2393
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,070
this and I don't know I find it the
most articulated and clear

2394
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,460
most articulated and clear and it's
easier

2395
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:58,830
most articulated and clear and it's
easier to

2396
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,690
most articulated and clear and it's
easier to control one finger

2397
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,760
most articulated and clear and it's
easier to control one finger than

2398
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,860
easier to control one finger than
three

2399
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,300
easier to control one finger than
three So again but

2400
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,630
easier to control one finger than
three So again but it's

2401
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,060
three So again but it's completely
up

2402
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,220
three So again but it's completely
up to you again the

2403
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,230
up to you Again the key is to
articulate

2404
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,860
up to you again the key to
articulate all the notes

2405
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,150
articulate all the notes and not
play

2406
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,390
articulate all the notes and not
play it

2407
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,010
articulate all the notes and not
play it not play

2408
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,160
the key to articulate all the notes
and not play it, not play the court.

2409
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,610
and not play it, not play the court.
Too

2410
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,850
and not play it, not play the court.
Too fast and too harsh

2411
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,590
Too fast and too harsh Another thing
is very

2412
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,060
Too fast and too harsh Another thing
is very important

2413
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,550
Too fast and too harsh Another thing
is very important is

2414
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,570
Too fast and too harsh Another thing
is very important is the

2415
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:13,880
Too fast and too harsh Another thing
is very important is the buzzing

2416
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,480
is very important is the buzzing
issue

2417
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,390
is very important is the buzzing
issue when

2418
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,760
buzzing issue when you have
difficult bar chords.

2419
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,030
There's a

2420
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,440
There's a little

2421
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,740
There's a little bit

2422
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,380
There's a little bit of a danger
that

2423
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,560
There's a little bit of a danger
that the

2424
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,150
There's a little bit of a danger
that the court

2425
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,590
There's a little bit of a danger
that the court will

2426
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,900
that the court will start buzzing,
for example.

2427
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,930
So.

2428
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,270
Like

2429
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,750
Like this

2430
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,320
This so if you

2431
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,730
This so if you go too

2432
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,430
This so if you go too much to the

2433
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,590
This so if you go too much to the
left

2434
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,300
This so if you go too much to the
left and

2435
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,360
This so if you go too much to the
left and you are not precise.

2436
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,290
left and you are not precise.
It the

2437
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,190
left and you are not precise.
The court

2438
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,850
left and you are not precise.
It the court will start buzzing So

2439
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,070
It the court will start buzzing So
this is something we

2440
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,240
It the court will start buzzing so
this is something we want to

2441
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,800
this is something we want to avoid
You can

2442
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,560
this is something we want to avoid
you can avoid

2443
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,610
this is something we want to avoid
You can avoid this

2444
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:39,960

The buzzing

2463
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,000
The buzzing notes

2464
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,350
The buzzing notes can

00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,230
The buzzing notes can happen

2466
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,700
The buzzing notes can happen very
easily and of course

2467
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:55,990

We have

2476
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,020
We have to practice

2477
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,760
We have to practice in and

2478
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,290

avoid it as much as possible So
again be

2486
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,560
avoid it as much as possible So
again be very

2487
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,880
avoid it as much as possible So
again be very precise and

2488
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,040
avoid it as much as possible So
again be very precise and listen to

2489
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,280
be very precise and listen to the
sound.

2490
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,300

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,080
Again no strength needed

2497
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,970
Again no strength needed just very

2498
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,040
Again no strength needed just very
light press

2499
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,660
Again no strength needed just very
light press You don't need to

2500
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:21,680
Again no strength needed just very
light press You don't need to hold

2501
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,480
light press you don't need to hold
on to

2502
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,830

light press You don't need to hold
on to the neck with

2505
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:24,690
on to the neck with too much
pressure

2506
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,100
on to the neck with too much
pressure It's

2507
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,150
on to the neck with too much
pressure It's completely

2508
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,470
on to the neck with too much
pressure It's completely unnecessary

2509
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,160
pressure It's completely unnecessary
Just make sure that

2510
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,630
pressure It's completely unnecessary
Just make sure that your hand

2511

relaxed Again this is also for the
sake of preserving

2517
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,700
relaxed again this is also for the
sake of preserving the

2518
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,100
sake of preserving the energy for
later

2519
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,470
sake of preserving the energy for
later because

2520
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,430
sake of preserving the energy for
later because we have some difficult

2521
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,700
later because we have some difficult
bar

2522
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,210
later because we have some difficult
bar cords coming

2523
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:35,760
later because we have some difficult
bar cords coming up

2524
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
because we have some difficult bar
cords coming up, so it's very light.

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,330
And then we

2614
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:42,640
And then we have

2615
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,060
And then we have bar 3030

2616
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,230
And then we have bar 3033

2617
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,940
And then we have bar 3033 to 36.

2618
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,930
Here I think

2619
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,370
Here I think the

2620
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,380
Here I think the beginning

2621
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,500
Here I think the beginning of

2622
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,680
Here I think the beginning of this

2623
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,080
Here I think the beginning of this
section

2624
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,870
Here I think the beginning of this
section should

2625
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,600
Here I think the beginning of this
section should be the

2626
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:53,940
Here I think the beginning of this
section should be the loudest point

2627
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,590
section should be the loudest point
in the

2628
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,200
section should be the loudest point
the A

2629
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,490
section should be the loudest point
in the A section

2630
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:55,830
section should be the loudest point
in the a section because

2631
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,930
point in the a section,
because it's just a.

2632
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,400
It's at this high

2633
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,280
It's at this high court and I

2634
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,750
It's at this high court and I think
the

2635
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,810
It's at this High Court and I think
the music is kind of.

2636
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,270
Calming down

2637
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,160
Calming down after that

2638
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,980
Calming down after that section

2639
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,080
Calming down after that section a
little

2640
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
Calming down after that section a
little bit

2641
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,640
Calming down after that section a
little bit so you

2642
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,180
Calming down after that section a
little bit so you can

2643
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,760
Calming down after that section a
little bit so you can again

2644
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,510
Calming down after that section a
little bit so you can again do

2645
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,060
Calming down after that section a
little bit so you can again do a

2646
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,740
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo

2647
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:12,970
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before

2648
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,430
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before bar

2649
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,740
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before bar in the

2650
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,090
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before bar in the bar

2651
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,400
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before bar in the bar 30

2652
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,130
little bit so you can again do a
crescendo before bar in the bar 32

2653
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,300
crescendo before bar in the bar 32
and

2654
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,620
crescendo before bar in the bar 32
and 30

2655
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,300
crescendo before bar in the bar 32
and 33 and then

2656
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,640
crescendo before bar in the bar 32
and 33 and then just emphasize

2657
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:17,790
crescendo before bar in the bar 32
and 33 and then just emphasize that

2658
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,300
and 33 and then just emphasize that
cord a little bit

2659
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,470
and 33 and then just emphasize that
cord a little bit more than

2660
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:19,790
and 33 and then just emphasize that
cord a little bit more than the

2661
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,180
cord a little bit more than the rest
of

2662
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,020
cord a little bit more than the rest
of the

2663
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,610
cord a little bit more than the rest
of the chords

2664
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:21,810
cord a little bit more than the rest
of the chords again

2665
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,020
cord a little bit more than the rest
of the chords Again we have

2666
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,530
cord a little bit more than the rest
of the chords Again we have the

2667
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,140
of the chords Again we have the
baseline

2668
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,610
we have the baseline in the main
melody.

2669
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,670
We have to

2670
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,530
We have to maintain that as well.

2671
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,020
We have to maintain that as well.

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm playing too fast right now but
this is just to

2711
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm playing too fast right now but
this is just to demonstrate

2712
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,680
this is just to demonstrate O again
before

2713
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,830
this is just to demonstrate O again
before you

2714
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,210

before you go into the bar

2717
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,790
this is just to demonstrate O again
before you go into the bar 30

2718
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,180
again, before you go into the bar 37,
a little crescendo.

2719
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,070
Would like and again

2720
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,570
Would like and again just

2721
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:10,960
Would like and again just start

2722
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,220
Would like and again just start 130

2723
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,400
Would like and again just start 137

2724
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,740
Would like and again just start 137
on time with no

2725
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,150
Would like and again just start 137
on time with no breaks

2726
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,400
Would like and again just start 137
on time with no breaks in

2727
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Would like and again just start 137
on time with no breaks in between

2728
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Would like and again just start 137
on time with no breaks in between so

2729
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
on time with no breaks in between So
this is a little

2730
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,520
on time with no breaks in between so
this is a little again

2731
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,890
on time with no breaks in between So
this is a little again a

2732
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,010
on time with no breaks in between So
this is a little again a tricky

2733
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,140
this is a little again a tricky
section

2734
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,300
this is a little again a tricky
section because

2735
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,710
this is a little again a tricky
section because again

2736
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,360
this is a little again a tricky
section because again we

2737
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,330
section because again we have this
difficult bar remember

2738
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,790
difficult bar Remember what we
talked about before making

2739
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,060
difficult bar Remember what we
talked about before making sure

2740
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,630
talked about before making sure you
relaxed the left hand.

2741
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,020
It's

2742
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,500
It's difficult because

2743
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:28,990
It's difficult because we have

2744
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,710
It's difficult because we have the
4th

2745
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,160
It's difficult because we have the
4th fingers

2746
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,280
It's difficult because we have the
4th fingers finger

2747
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,230
It's difficult because we have the
4th fingers finger stretched

2748
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,600
It's difficult because we have the
4th fingers finger stretched here

2749
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,360
4th fingers finger stretched here so
this is

2750
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,430
4th fingers finger stretched here so
this is a little

2751
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,840
4th fingers finger stretched here so
this is a little bit

2752
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,500
4th fingers finger stretched here so
this is a little bit of

2753
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,220
this is a little bit of attention
Sometimes there's

2754
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,840
this is a little bit of attention
Sometimes there's a tension

2755
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,190
this is a little bit of attention
Sometimes there's a tension in

2756
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,520
this is a little bit of attention
Sometimes there's a tension in the

2757
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:37,970
Sometimes there's a tension in the
left hand because whenever

2758
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,490
Sometimes there's a tension in the
left hand because whenever you

2759
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,100
Sometimes there's a tension in the
left hand because whenever you have

2760
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
left hand because whenever you have
an

2761
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,850
left hand because whenever you have
an extended fourth finger

2762
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,000
left hand because whenever you have
an extended fourth finger it

2763
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,110
left hand because whenever you have
an extended fourth finger it creates

2764
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,690
an extended fourth finger it creates
a

2765
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:41,810
an extended fourth finger it creates
a little bit

2766
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,420
an extended fourth finger it creates
a little bit of tension

2767
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,110
an extended fourth finger it creates
a little bit of tension right

2768
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,210
an extended fourth finger it creates
a little bit of tension right here

2769
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:43,700
a little bit of tension right here
so you

2770
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,790
a little bit of tension right here
So you want to

2771
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,530
a little bit of tension right here
So you want to try to

2772
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:45,930
a little bit of tension right here
So you want to try to avoid that

2773
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,060
a little bit of tension right here
So you want to try to avoid that as

2774
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,160
So you want to try to avoid that as

So

2879
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,550
So the

2880
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,950
So the transition from

2881
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,230
The transition from bar 30

2882
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,750
The transition from bar 39

2883
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,010
The transition from bar 39 to 40

2884
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,400
The transition from bar 39 to 40 is

2885
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,620
The transition from bar 39 to 40 is
probably

2886
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:11,970
The transition from bar 39 to 40 is
probably for

2887
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:12,520
The transition from bar 39 to 40 is
probably for me personally the

2888
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,900
probably for me personally the
trickiest part

2889
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,230
probably for me personally the
trickiest part in this

2890
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,830
probably for me personally the
trickiest part in this a

2891
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,390
probably for me personally the
trickiest part in this a section

2892
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,280
trickiest part in this A section
really

2893
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,440
trickiest part in this a section
really difficult because

2894
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,570
trickiest part in this a section
really difficult because you have

2895
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,130

this

2896
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,380
really difficult because you have
this chord.

2897
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,660
And then

2898
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,260
And then you

2899
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,640
And then you have to go here.

2900
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,250
So

2901
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,170
So your

2902
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,330
So your first

2903
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:27,910
So your first finger

2904
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,080
So your first finger is

2905
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,950
So your first finger is going

2906
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,210
So your first finger is going to
have

2907
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:29,600
So your first finger is going to
have to

2908
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,200
So your first finger is going to
have to really

2909
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,380
So your first finger is going to
have to really press

2910
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:31,660
So your first finger is going to
have to really press all the

00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,770
have to really press all the strings
with

2912
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,340
have to really press all the strings
with it will have

2913
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,740
have to really press all the strings
with it will have to be

2914
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,250
have to really press all the strings
with it will have to be completely

2915
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:35,450
with It will have to be completely
straight

2916
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,730
with it will have to be completely
straight so

2917
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,440
with It will have to be completely
straight So if you do if you move

2918
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,540
with It will have to be completely
straight So if you do if you move a

2919
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,930
straight So if you do if you move a
little bit

2920

straight So if you do if you move a
little bit to

00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,060
straight So if you do if you move a
little bit to the

00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,780
to the right,
it's going to create buzzing, so.

2926
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,720

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:01,820
What you can do in between again is
to stop

2942
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,590
What you can do in between again is
to stop and then

2943
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,820
What you can do in between again is
to stop and then readjust

2944
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,850
to stop and then readjust your
finger

2945
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,420
to stop and then readjust your
finger and then start

2946
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,810
to stop and then readjust your
finger and then start playing

2947
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,080
finger and then start playing it. So
for example.

2948
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,430
Stop and then.

2949
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,860
And then stop

2950
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:18,950
And then stop again

2951
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,260
And then stop again before you

2952
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,500
And then stop again before you go

2953
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:19,740
And then stop again before you go to
the next

2954
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,800
And then stop again before you go to
the next chord so

2955
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,320
And then stop again before you go to
the next chord So again

2956
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,780
And then stop again before you go to
the next chord So again the

2957
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,210
the next chord so again the
transition

2958
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,640
the next chord So again the
transition is

2959
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,130
the next chord So again the
transition is pretty pretty

2960
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:26,710
transition is pretty pretty
difficult but

2961
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,920
transition is pretty pretty
difficult but I think

2962
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,210
transition is pretty pretty
difficult but I think part

2963
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:27,620
transition is pretty pretty
difficult but I think part of

2964
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,750
transition is pretty pretty
difficult but I think part of it

2965
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,380
difficult but I think part of it is
because of

2966
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:28,900
difficult but I think part of it is
because of the tension

2967
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,190
difficult but I think part of it is
because of the tension in the

2968
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,480
because of the tension in the left
hand

2969
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,610
because of the tension in the left
hand I

2970
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:29,970
because of the tension in the left
hand I have

2971
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:30,230
because of the tension in the left
hand I have a lot

2972
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,580
because of the tension in the left
hand I have a lot of tension

2973
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:30,660
because of the tension in the left
hand I have a lot of tension here

2974
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,950
hand I have a lot of tension here I
don't know why

2975
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,730
hand I have a lot of tension here I
don't know why I think it's

2976
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:31,890
hand I have a lot of tension here I
don't know why I think it's just

2977
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,340
don't know why I think it's just
because

2978
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,320
don't know why I think it's just
because I know

2979
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,480
don't know why I think it's just
because I know that

2980
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,990
because I know that the difficult
part is

2981
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,870
because I know that the difficult
part is coming

2982
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,650
because I know that the difficult
part is coming up So I

2983

to relax even more to preserve that
energy So

2995
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,160

energy so part of

2996
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,360
to relax even more to preserve that
energy So part of the

2997
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,750

3102
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,060
relax here and maybe a little
decrescendo because the

3103
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,200
relax here and maybe a little
decrescendo because the music is

3104
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,490
decrescendo because the music is
kind

3105
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:51,870
decrescendo because the music is
kind of

3106
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,300
decrescendo because the music is
kind of calming

3107
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,850
decrescendo because the music is
kind of calming down

3108
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,280
kind of calming down a little bit
and

3109
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,800
kind of calming down a little bit
and I

3110
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,110
kind of calming down a little bit
and I think

3111
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,340
kind of calming down a little bit
and I think the

3112
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,980
kind of calming down a little bit
and I think the highest

3113
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,080
kind of calming down a little bit
and I think the highest point

3114
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,540
kind of calming down a little bit
and I think the highest point in the

3115
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,910
and I think the highest point in the
in

3116
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,640
and I think the highest point in the
piece

3117
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,140
and I think the highest point in the
in the piece in the

3118
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,190
in the piece in the eighth section
was

3119
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,760
in the piece in the eighth section
was this

3120
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,400
in the piece in the eighth section
was this and

3121
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,510
in the piece in the eighth section
was this and then

3122
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,980
in the piece in the eighth section
was this and then later

3123
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,470
in the piece in the eighth section
was this and then later on

3124
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,000
in the piece in the eighth section
was this and then later on you can

3125
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,960
was this And then later on you can
slowly

3126
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,040
was this And then later on you can
slowly and gradually

3127
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,670
was this And then later on you can
slowly and gradually start

3128
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,300
was this And then later on you can
slowly and gradually start to

3129
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,710
slowly and gradually start to
decrescendo and

3130
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,030
slowly and gradually start to
decrescendo and we're nearing

3131
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,190
decrescendo and we're nearing the
end

3132
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,510
decrescendo and we're nearing the
end of the

3133
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,070
decrescendo and we're nearing the
end of the association so

3134
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,290
decrescendo and we're nearing the
end of the association so I

3135
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,590
end of the association so I think
section

3136
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:07,850
end of the association so I think
section by

3137
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:07,910
end of the association so I think
section by section

3138
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,360
end of the association So I think
section by section you can start

3139
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,500
end of the association So I think
section by section you can start to

3140
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,920
section by section you can start to
play

3141
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,190
section by section you can start to
play a

3142
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,080
section by section you can start to
play a little bit

3143
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,620
section you can start to play a
little bit less with less volume.

3144
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,680
little bit less with less volume.
Technically everything you

3145
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:13,820
little bit less with less volume.
Technically everything

3146
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,060
little bit less with less volume.
Technically everything that

3147
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,360
Technically everything that we
talked

3148
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,800
Technically everything that we
talked about before

3149
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,610
Technically everything that we
talked about before applies

3150
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,220
Technically everything that we
talked about before applies here

3151
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,500
Technically everything that we
talked about before applies here as

3152
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,830
before applies here as well with
make sure the bars.

3153
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,780
Our

3154
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,080
Our nice and clean.

3155
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,860
And take

3156
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,930
And take those breaks in between

3157
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,050
And take those breaks in between the
cords.

3158
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,070
And

3159
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,400
And association to the

3160
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,590
And association to the triplets

3161
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:40,960
And association to the triplets as
well they also

3162
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,300
And association to the triplets as
well They also have to

3163
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,780
well They also have to be
articulated

3164
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,180
well They also have to be
articulated as well

3165
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,390
well They also have to be
articulated as well just

3166
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:43,650
well They also have to be
articulated as well just like in

3167
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,020
well They also have to be
articulated as well just like in the

3168
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,090
also have to be articulated as well,
just like in the previous sections.

3169
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,380
just like in the previous sections.
Again, you can practice.

3170
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,520
So I

3171
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,850
So I think

3172
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,380
So I think that's

3173
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,710
So I think that's about

3174
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,020
So I think that's about it

3175
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,870
So I think that's about it but

3176
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,230
So I think that's about it But the
key

3177
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,120
So I think that's about it but the
key here I think the

3178
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,530
So I think that's about it but the
key here I think the most

3179
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,510
key here I think the most difficult
things here

3180
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,240
key here I think the most difficult
things here is the

3181
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,300
key here I think the most difficult
things here is the bar

3182
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,080
key here I think the most difficult
things here is the bar chords

3183
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,680
things here is the bar chords So
you're

3184
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,120
things here is the bar chords So
you're going

3185
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,700
things here is the bar chords So
you're going to have to

3186
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,320
things here is the bar chords So
you're going to have to find the way

3187
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,460
you're going to have to find the way
to

3188
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:18,760
you're going to have to find the way
to really

3189
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,320
you're going to have to find the way
to really really

3190
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,460
going to have to find the way to
really, really relax your.

3191

really, really relax your.
And because

3192
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:21,970
really, really relax your.
And because I don't

3193
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,390
really, really relax your.
And because I don't want

3194
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,690
really, really relax your.
And because I don't want any

3195
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,060
And because I don't want any
injuries

3196
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,310
And because I don't want any
injuries to happen

3197
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,010
And because I don't want any
injuries to happen or you

3198
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,350
And because I don't want any
injuries to happen or

00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,030
And because I don't want any
injuries to happen or with pressing

3200
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,350
injuries to happen or with pressing
too hard

3201
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:26,830
injuries to happen or with pressing
too hard and

3202
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,580
injuries to happen or with pressing
too hard and using too much pressure.

3203
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,670
You don't

3204
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,350
You don't want to injure your hands

3205
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:30,900
You don't want to injure your hands
so

3206
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,130
You don't want to injure your hands
so you again

3207
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,800
You don't want to injure your hands
so you again you have

3208
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,200
You don't want to injure your hands
so you again you have to

3209
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,980
You don't want to injure your hands
so you again you have to be very

3210

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,250
so you again you have to be very
very careful and

3212
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,410
so you again you have to be very
very careful and to

3213
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:35,450
so you again you have to be very
very careful and to press with

3214
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,170
very careful and to press with
minimal

3215
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:36,790
very careful and to press with
minimal strength

3216
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,540
very careful and to press with
minimal strength as

3217
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:37,910
very careful and to press with
minimal strength as you

3218
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,080
very careful and to press with
minimal strength as you can

3219
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,320
very careful and to press with
minimal strength as you can just

3220
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,960
minimal strength as you can just to
just

3221
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,330
minimal strength as you can to just
to

3222
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:39,620
minimal strength as you can to
preserve that

3223
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,040
minimal strength as you can to
preserve that energy

3224
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,420
minimal strength as you can to
preserve that energy in

3225
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:40,640
minimal strength as you can to
preserve that energy in your

hand And don't be afraid to take
breaks in between the sections you

3238
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:45,890
breaks in between the sections you
can

3239
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,360
breaks in between the sections You
can always do that

3240
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,590
breaks in between the sections You
can always do that you

3241
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:46,980
breaks in between the sections You
can always do that you don't have

3242
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,120
can always do that. You don't have
to play the piece.

3243
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,950
Practice the

3244
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,270
Practice the piece all the way

3245
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,750
Practice the piece all the way
through

3246
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,050
Practice the piece all the way
through you can

3247
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,770
Practice the piece all the way
through you can take

3248
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,340
Practice the piece all the way
through You can take sections

3249
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,850
through You can take sections and
make

3250
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,980
through You can take sections and
make breaks in

3251
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,140
through You can take sections and
make breaks in between

3252
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,410
make breaks in between until you
feel

3253
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:55,490
make breaks in between until you
feel that

3254
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:55,930
make breaks in between until you
feel that your

3255
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,310
make breaks in between until you
feel that your hand

3256
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,720
make breaks in between until you
feel that your hand is

3257
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,970
make breaks in between until you
feel that your hand is relaxed

3258
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,290
feel that your hand is relaxed again
So don't

3259

3261
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,140
So don't rush through it.
The next two measures

3262
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,970
So don't rush through it.
The next two measures 45

3263
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,230
So don't rush through it.
The next two measures 45 and

3365
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,060
So

3366
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,370
So let's

3367
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,730
So let's go

3368
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,980
So let's go section

3369
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,510
So let's go section by section

3370
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,330
So let's go section by section 40

3371
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,550
So let's go section by section 49 to
52.

3372
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,430
52.
Again the

3373
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,810
52.
Again the beginning This is

3374
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,070
52.
Again the beginning This is like

3375
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,260
the beginning. This is like just
like the beginning.

3376
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,010
Then make

3377
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,460
Then make sure that we hear.

3378
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,330
That

3379
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,990
That baseline very

3380
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,970
That baseline very very

3381
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,060
That baseline very very nicely

3382
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,540
That baseline very very nicely and

3383
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:07,800
That baseline very very nicely and
then 50

3384
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,150
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53

3385
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,590
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 60

3386
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:08,960
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 62

3387
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,280
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 62 this

3388
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,300
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 62 this is the

3389
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,420
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 62 this is the end

3390
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:10,610
That baseline very very nicely and
then 53 to 62 this is the end so

3391
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,730
then 53 to 62 this is the end So
this

3392
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,010
then 53 to 62 this is the end So
this is

3393
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,030
then 53 to 62 this is the end So
this is the last

3394
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,430
then 53 to 62 this is the end So
this is the last stretch

3395
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,740
this is the end. So this is the last
stretch, the triplets.

3396
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,200
This

3397
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,730
This is

3398
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,230
This is a tricky

3399
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,580
This is a tricky section

3400
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,450
This is a tricky section for

3401
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:21,870
This is a tricky section for the
left

3402
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:21,980
This is a tricky section for the
left hand

3403
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,460
This is a tricky section for the
left hand because

3404
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,790
This is a tricky section for the
left hand because you

3405
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,220
left hand because you have the bar
again.

3406
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,750
And then you have to

3407
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,270
And then you have to lift the

3408
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,700
And then you have to lift the bar

3409
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,070
And then you have to lift the bar in
order to play.

3410
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,970
So it's going

3411
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,150
So it's going to take

3412
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,120
So it's going to take some

3413
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,960
So it's going to take some work work
here.

3414
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,360
here.
Here

3415
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,570
here.
Here there

3416
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,440
here.
Here there could

3417
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,580
here.
Here there could also

3418
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,060
here.
Here there could also be

3419
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,470
Here there could also be some
tension

3420
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,070
Here there could also be some
tension in

3421
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,530
Here there could also be some
tension in the left

3422
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:45,590
Here there could also be some
tension in the left hand to due to

3423
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,720
tension in the left hand to due to
this

3424
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,240
tension in the left hand to due to
this you

3425
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,310
tension in the left hand to due to
this pressing

3426
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:47,720
tension in the left hand to due to
this pressing and

3427
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,230

want to end in a louder dynamic,
you can.

3595
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,620
you can.
So just depends what

3596
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,230
you can.
So just depends what your

3597
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,200
you can.
So just depends what your vision of

3598
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,640
So just depends what your vision of
this last

3599
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,370
So just depends what your vision of
this last part of the

3600
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:53,490
So just depends what your vision of
this last part of the piece

3601
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,900
So just depends what your vision of
this last part of the piece and how

3602
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,390
this last part of the piece and how
you

3603
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,540
this last part of the piece and how
you would

3604
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,080
this last part of the piece and how
you would like to

3605
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,570
this last part of the piece and how
you would like to interpret it

3606
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:55,740
this last part of the piece and how
you would like to interpret it it's

3607
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,150
you would like to interpret it it's
completely up to

3608
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,290
you would like to interpret it It's
completely up to you so

3609
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:56,610
you would like to interpret it It's
completely up to you So there's

3610
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:56,800
you would like to interpret it It's
completely up to you So there's a

3611
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,060
completely up to you So there's a
lot

3612
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,400
completely up to you. So there's a
lot of freedom here, but.

3613
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,280
I would

3614
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,570
I would suggest

3615
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,370
I would suggest a

3616
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,480
I would suggest a nice ritardando

3617
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,340
I would suggest a nice ritardando at
the

3618
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,470
I would suggest a nice ritardando at
the end

3619
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,820
I would suggest a nice ritardando at
the end, just very gradual.

3620
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,110
You can wait

3621
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:14,470
You can wait before you play

3622
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,720
You can wait before you play the

3623
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,110
You can wait before you play the
last chord.

3624
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,360
So

3625
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,130
So not too loud but

3626
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:19,470
So not too loud but again

3627
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:19,560
So not too loud but again it's

3628
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
So not too loud but again it's
completely

3629
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,800
So not too loud but again it's
completely up to you

3630
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:20,960
So not too loud but again it's
completely up to you and

3631
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,710
So not too loud but again it's
completely up to you And this is

3632
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,020
So not too loud but again it's
completely up to you And this is how

3633
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,720
completely up to you and this is how
you

3634
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,950
So not too loud but again it's
completely up to you And this is how

3635
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,140
completely up to you And this is how
we

3636
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,380
completely up to you And this is how
we end

3637
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:23,430
completely up to you And this is how
we end the

3638
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,320
completely up to you And this is how
we end the a section

3639
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,750
completely up to you And this is how
we end the a section I

3640
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,980
completely up to you And this is how
we end the a section I think

3641
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,320
completely up to you and this is how
we end the a section I think before

3642
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,320
we end the a section I think before
the

3643
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,960
is how we end the a section,
I think before the B section.

3644
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,030
Perhaps.

3645
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,990
Perhaps.
It's

3646
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,120
Perhaps.
It's good to

3647
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,400
Perhaps.
It's good to the B section

3648
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,880
Perhaps.
It's good to the B section is

3649
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,250
It's good to the B section is
obviously

3650
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:35,600
It's good to the B section is
obviously not

3651
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,160
It's good to the B section is
obviously not technically very

3652
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,540
obviously not technically very
difficult so

3653
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,470
obviously not technically very
difficult so I

3654
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:37,650
obviously not technically very
difficult so I think

3655
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,340
obviously not technically very
difficult so I think the most work

3656
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:38,620
difficult so I think the most work
will go into

3657
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,020
difficult so I think the most work
will go into the

3658
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,700
difficult so I think the most work
will go into a

3659
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,080
will go into a section in the B
section

3660
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,410
will go into a section In the B
section you can

3661
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:41,970
will go into a section In the B
section you can finally

3662
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,970
will go into a section In the B
section you can finally relax

3663
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,470
will go into a section In the B
section you can finally relax and

3664
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,290
section you can finally relax and
play

3665
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,760
into a section. In the B section you
can finally relax and play it just.

00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:47,910
Again a couple of general things
before we go into the section

3758
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,190
Again a couple of general things
before we go into the section The

3759
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,510
before we go into the section the
metronome

3760
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,110
before we go into the section The
metronome should be

3761
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:50,580
before we go into the section the
metronome should be on for

3762
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,830
before we go into the section The
metronome should be on for this

3763
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:52,110
metronome should be on for this
section as

3764
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:52,360
metronome should be on for this
section as well I

3765
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:52,710
metronome should be on for this
section as well I know

3766
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,290
metronome should be on for this
section as well I know this

3767
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:53,870
metronome should be on for this
section as well I know this is

3768
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:54,220
metronome should be on for this
section as well I know this is a

3769
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,250
section as well I know this is a
much slower

3770
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,300
much slower section and easier
technically but

3771
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,430
much slower section and easier
technically but still

3772
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:57,950
much slower section and easier
technically but still I think

3773
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:58,390
much slower section and easier
technically but still I think it

3774
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,600
much slower section and easier
technically but still I think it is

3775
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,530
technically but still I think it is
it is

3776
00:46:59,530 --> 00:46:59,790
technically but still I think it is
it is important

3777
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,720
technically but still I think it is
it is important to be

3778
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,090
technically but still I think it is
it is important to be on time

3779
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:01,820
It is important to be on time and to
have

3780
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,150
It is important to be on time and to
have the

3781
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,020
It is important to be on time and to
have the rhythm

3782
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,220
it is important to be on time and to
have the rhythm very

3783
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:03,550
It is important to be on time and to
have the rhythm very very clear

3784
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,210
It is important to be on time and to
have the rhythm very very clear So

3785
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,430
have the rhythm very very clear So
and

3786
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:04,770
have the rhythm very very clear so
and to also establish

3787
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,070
have the rhythm very very clear So
and to also establish the

3788

Is more with more breathing

3804
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,200
Is more with more breathing in
between the measures

3805

between the measures There's no need
to rush anywhere

3809
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,870
between the measures There's no need
to rush anywhere you can

3810
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,950
between the measures There's no need
to rush anywhere you can try to

3811
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:21,430
to rush anywhere you can try to
sustain

again when you have a piece with

3834
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,150
expressive Very expressive here just
again when you have a piece with you

3835
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:33,730
again when you have a piece with
several different sections

3836
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:33,850
again when you have a piece with
several different sections it's

3837
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,270
several different sections it's
always good

3838
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,500
several different sections it's
always good to

3839
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:35,870
several different sections it's
always good to have as

3840
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,490
several different sections it's
always good to have as much of a

3841
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,650
always good to have as much of a
contrast as possible

3842
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,490
always good to have as much of a
contrast as possible in

3843
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,320
contrast as possible in between
those

3844
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,440
contrast as possible in between
those sections

3845
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:39,880
contrast as possible in between
those sections So this

3846
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,300
contrast as possible in between
those sections So this is

3847
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,500
contrast as possible in between
those sections So this is your

3848
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,180
those sections So this is your
chance

3849
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,350
so this is your chance to explore
that here.

3850
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:43,670
So

3851
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,600
So we're going to

3852
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,790
So we're going to begin with

3853
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,560
So we're going to begin with the B

3854
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,150
So we're going to begin with the B
section

3855
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:47,610
So we're going to begin with the B
section begins with

3856
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:47,920
section begins with these octaves So
we're

3857
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,760
section begins with these octaves So
we're going to work on the

3858
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,290
section begins with these octaves So
we're going to work on the bars 60

3859
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:51,810
section begins with these octaves So
we're going to work on the bars 63

3860
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,630
we're going to work on the bars 63
to

3861
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,490
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 70

3862
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:53,860
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and

3863
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,340
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and we

3864
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,780
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and we start

3865
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,260
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and we start with

3866
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:55,530
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and we start with the

3867
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:55,850
we're going to work on the bars 63
to 78 and we start with the octaves

3868
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,030
to 78 and we start with the octaves
right so

3869
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,640
63 to 78 and we start with the
octaves, right, so we have.

3870
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,570
And

3871
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:03,780
And then

3872
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:03,970
And then we have

3873
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,910
And then we have these

3874
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,990
And then we have these chords

3875
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,540
And then we have these chords So my

3876
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,210
And then we have these chords So my
suggestion here

3877
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:08,390
And then we have these chords So my
suggestion here would be to play

3878
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,400
suggestion here would be to play
these

3879
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,750
suggestion here would be to play
these chords together

3880
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,360
suggestion here would be to play
these chords together What

3881
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,690
suggestion here would be to play
these chords together What i

3882
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,700
suggestion here would be to play
these chords together What I mean

3883
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,120
suggestion here would be to play
these chords together What I mean by

3884
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,500
these chords together What I mean by
together

3885
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,050
these chords together What I mean by
together is

3886
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,500
these chords together What I mean by
together is simultaneously together

3887
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:15,550
together is simultaneously together
not separate

3888
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,010
by together is simultaneously
together, not separate like this.

3889
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,170
It just

3890
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,660
It just doesn't

3891
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,030
It just doesn't sound

3892
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:22,330
It just doesn't sound so good

3893
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:22,590
It just doesn't sound so good So

3894
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,000
It just doesn't sound so good So it

3895
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,120
It just doesn't sound so good So it
just

3896
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,310
It just doesn't sound so good So it
just sounds

3897
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:23,550
It just doesn't sound so good so it
just sounds more

3898
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,100
It just doesn't sound so good so it
just sounds more musical

3899
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,450
It just doesn't sound so good So it
just sounds more musical It makes

3900
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:24,780
just sounds more musical It makes
more sense

3901
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,180
just sounds more musical It makes
more sense if

3902
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:25,920
just sounds more musical It makes
more sense if you play

3903
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,440
more sense if you play it together
like this.

3904
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
There's a

3905
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,050
There's a little bit

3906
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:31,490
There's a little bit of a

3907
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:31,790
There's a little bit of a issue here

3908
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:32,990
There's a little bit of a issue here
with

3909
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:33,140
There's a little bit of a issue here
with these

3910
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,520
There's a little bit of a issue here
with these especially

3911
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:33,700
There's a little bit of a issue here
with these especially in

3912
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,680
with these especially in slower
movements

3913
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,920
with these especially in slower
movements because there

3914
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,710
with these especially in slower
movements because there is more it's

3915
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,190
movements because there is more it's
more

3916
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,850
movements because there is more it's
more peaceful and more

3917
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,250
movements because there is more it's
more peaceful and more quiet

3918
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:40,660
movements because there is more It's
more peaceful and more quiet I

3919
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:40,860
movements because there is more It's
more peaceful and more quiet I think

3920
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,560
more peaceful and more quiet I think
the

3921
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,910
more peaceful and more quiet I think
the noise the

3922
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,680
more peaceful and more quiet I think
noise the string noise can be

3923
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,210
more peaceful and more quiet I think
noise the string noise can be a

3924
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:43,710
noise the string noise can be a
little bit

3925
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:43,980
noise the string noise can be a
little bit more

3926
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,480
noise the string noise can be a
little bit more visible when

3927
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:44,820
noise the string noise can be a
little bit more visible when we have

3928
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,070
little bit more visible when we have
something

3929
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:45,560
little bit more visible when we have
something that is

3930
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,170
little bit more visible when we have
something that is very

3931
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,760
little bit more visible when we have
something that is very quiet

3932
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,320
something that is very quiet and
soothing and slow

3933
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,490
something that is very quiet and
soothing and slow so

3934
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,220
something that is very quiet and
soothing and slow So just

3935
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,700
something that is very quiet and
soothing and slow So just be

3936
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:49,960
something that is very quiet and
soothing and slow So just be aware

3937
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,440
soothing and slow So just be aware
of

3938
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:50,950
soothing and slow So just be aware
of this noise in between

3939
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,320
soothing and slow So just be aware
of this noise in between when

3940
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:51,940
aware of this noise in between when
you're

3941
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,520
of this noise in between when you're
shifting

3942
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,920
of this noise in between when you're
shifting and

3943
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,370
shifting and when you're
transitioning

3944
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:53,490
shifting and when you're
transitioning just

3945
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:53,810
shifting and when you're
transitioning just be

3946
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:54,300
shifting and when you're
transitioning Just be aware

3947
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:54,630
shifting and when you're
transitioning Just be aware of

3948
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,010
transitioning. Just be aware of the
noise, for example.

3949
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,870
So there is a

3950
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,940
So there is a ways to avoid

3951
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,480
So there is a ways to avoid that

3952
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,250
So there is a ways to avoid that
noise you

3953
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:05,610
So there is a ways to avoid that
noise you have to

3954
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:05,920
So there is a ways to avoid that
noise You have to lift the

3955
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,260
So there is a ways to avoid that
noise You have to lift the fingers

3956
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,280
noise You have to lift the fingers a
little

3957
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,650
noise You have to lift the fingers a
little bit

3958
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,340
noise You have to lift the fingers a
little bit above

3959
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,530
noise You have to lift the fingers a
little bit above the

3960
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,070
a little bit above the string. Try
not to.

3961
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,090
Don't

3962
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:13,820
Don't slide because if you slide

3963
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,340
Don't slide because if you slide
there

3964
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,020
Don't slide because if you slide
there will be

3965
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,670
Don't slide because if you slide
there will be some noise there so

3966
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,510
there will be some noise there so
always

3967
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,570
there will be some noise there so
always lift the finger very

3968
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,680
there will be some noise there so
always lift the finger very very

3969
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,410
always lift the finger very very
slightly above the

3970
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:19,900
always lift the finger very very
slightly above the string So

3971
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,050
always lift the finger very very
slightly above the string so that

3972
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,470
slightly above the string so that
you

3973
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,780
finger very very slightly above the
string so that you avoid that noise.

3974
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,970
And

3975
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,600
And just keep

3976
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,140
And just keep the time very

3977
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,590
And just keep the time very clear

3978
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,100
And just keep the time very clear.
Don't rush.

3979
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Especially

3980
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,400
Especially here there's a

3981
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,610
Especially here there's a little
tendency

3982
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,240
Especially here there's a little
tendency to rush

3983
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,660
Especially here there's a little
tendency to rush there with

3984
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:33,810
Especially here there's a little
tendency to rush there with the

3985
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,290
Especially here there's a little
tendency to rush there with the 8th

3986
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:34,440
tendency to rush there with the 8th
notes

3987
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,110
tendency to rush there with the 8th
notes Just make

3988
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,570
tendency to rush there with the 8th
notes Just make sure

3989
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,830
tendency to rush there with the 8th
notes Just make sure you

3990
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,150
there with the 8th notes. Just make
sure you play in time, so.

3991
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,520
I think as far as

3992
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:40,880
I think as far as these

3993
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,430
I think as far as these chords.

3994
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,000
You will

3995
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,110
You will find different

3996
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:45,550
You will find different versions of

3997
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,270
You will find different versions of
course but

3998
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:46,470
You will find different versions of
course but I

3999
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,000
You will find different versions of
course but I just

4000
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,620
You will find different versions of
course but I just do

4001
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,030
You will find different versions of
course but I just do a

4002
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:48,620
You will find different versions of
course but I just do a very

4003
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:48,740
You will find different versions of
course but I just do a very simple

4004
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:48,960
course but I just do a very simple
harmonic

4005
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,010
course but I just do a very simple
harmonic here in

4006
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,550
course but I just do a very simple
harmonic here in the

4007
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,610
course but I just do a very simple
harmonic here in the last bar

4008
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:50,990
course but I just do a very simple
harmonic here in the last bar which

4009
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,670
harmonic here in the last bar which
is bar 66

4010
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,180
harmonic here in the last bar which
is bar 66 with the

4011
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,490
harmonic here in the last bar which
is bar 66 with the cords

4012
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,060
harmonic here in the last bar which
is bar 66 With the cords you can

4013
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,210
is bar 66 With the cords you can
either

4014
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,940
is bar 66 With the cords you can
either appreciate

4015
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,090
is bar 66 With the cords you can
either appreciate them

4016
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:57,430
is bar 66 With the cords you can
either appreciate them I'm

4017
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,740
is bar 66 With the cords you can
either appreciate them I'm talking

4018

either appreciate them I'm talking
about the

4020
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,580
either appreciate them I'm talking
about the bar 65 here

4021
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,290
either appreciate them I'm talking
about the bar 65 here so you

4022
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:00,690
either appreciate them I'm talking
about the bar 65 here so you have

4023
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,400
about the bar 65 here so you have
the

4024
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,070
about the bar 65 here So you have
the sport you can

4025
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:02,170
about the bar 65 here So you have
the sport you can either

4026
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:02,460
about the bar 65 here So you have
the sport you can either arpeggiated

4027
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:02,470
the sport you can either arpeggiated
or

4028
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,550
the sport you can either arpeggiated
or play

4029
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:03,830
the sport you can either arpeggiated

4030
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,550
you can either arpeggiated or play
together. It's completely up to you.

4031
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,560
I

4032
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:06,930
I think

4033
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:07,290
I think it

4034
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:07,900
I think it sounds

4035
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,060
I think it sounds nice if

4036
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,400
I think it sounds nice if you
emphasize

4037
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,560
I think it sounds nice if you
emphasize it

4038
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,150
I think it sounds nice if you
emphasize it and if you

4039
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,150
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it

4040
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,450
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it it's just

4041
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:10,580
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it it's just I

4042
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:10,730
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it It's just I don't know

4043
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,420
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it It's just I don't know it's

4044
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,690
emphasize it and if you arpeggiate
it it's just I don't know it's just

4045
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:11,880
it it's just I don't know it's just
musically

4046
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,660
it It's just I don't know it's just
musically sounds

4047
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:12,900
it it's just I don't know it's just
musically sounds a

4048
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,520
it It's just I don't know it's just
musically sounds a little bit nicer

4049
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,730
musically sounds a little bit nicer
but again

4050
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,510
musically sounds a little bit nicer
but again it's

4051
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,730
musically sounds a little bit nicer
but again it's completely

4052
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,040
musically sounds a little bit nicer
But again it's completely up to you

4053
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,210
but again it's completely up to you
So then we

4054
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:17,440
But again it's completely up to you
So then we have

4055
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,650
But again it's completely up to you
So then we have a cord

4056
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,350
But again it's completely up to you
So then we have a cord here

4057
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:19,970
But again it's completely up to you
So then we have a cord here in

4058
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,190
it's completely up to you. So then
we have a chord here in the bar 69.

4059
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,540
And

4060
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,960
And another

4061
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,190
And another one

4062
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,040
And another one here

4063
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,420
And another one here in

4064
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,290
And another one here in a bar 73.

4065
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,890
And another one here in a bar 73.
So again

4066
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,380
And another one here in a bar 73.
So again it's important

4067
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:31,660
And another one here in a bar 73.
So again it's important to

4068
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:31,920
And another one here in a bar 73.
So again it's important to hear all

4069
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,100
So again it's important to hear all
the

4070
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,470
So again it's important to hear all
the notes in the

4071
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,720
So again it's important to hear all
the notes in the court whether

4072
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,830
the notes in the court whether you
play

4073
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:35,830
the notes in the court whether you
play together or

4074
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,060
the notes in the court whether you
play together or separately make

4075
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,620
play together or separately make
sure

4076
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,780
whether you play together or
separately, make sure you emphasize.

4077
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,270
separately, make sure you emphasize.
Makes you dig

4078
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,350
separately, make sure you emphasize.
Makes you dig into that

4079

hear

4082
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,850
Makes you dig into that strings to
hear every

4083
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:43,580
Makes you dig into that strings to
hear every single

4084
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,630
to hear every single note in this in
these specific bars.

4085
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,060
these specific bars.
As

4086
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,850
these specific bars.
As far as

4087
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,870
these specific bars.
As far as dynamics

4088
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,040
these specific bars.
As far as dynamics here

4089
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,660
these specific bars.
As far as dynamics here here's

4090
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,100
As far as dynamics here here's the
chance to

4091
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,760
As far as dynamics here here's the
chance to really explore

4092
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,740
As far as dynamics here here's the
chance to really explore the

4093
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,070
chance to really explore the
dynamics here

4094
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:52,360
chance to really explore the
dynamics here so I'll talk

4095
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,540
chance to really explore the
dynamics here so I'll talk about

4096
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:52,730
chance to really explore the
dynamics here So I'll talk about a

4097
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,200
dynamics here so I'll talk about a
little

4098
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,390
dynamics here so I'll talk about a
little bit

4099
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:53,750
dynamics here So I'll talk about a
little bit about the

4100
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,000
little bit about the dynamics and
also

4101
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,130
little bit about the dynamics and
also the

4102
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,620
little bit about the dynamics and
also the color of

4103
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:55,870
little bit about the dynamics and
also the color of the

4104
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:56,270
little bit about the dynamics and
also the color of the sound I

4105
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:56,500
also the color of the sound I think
it's

4106
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,650
also the color of the sound I think
it's nice

4107
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,170
also the color of the sound I think
it's nice to

4108
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:57,710
also the color of the sound I think
it's nice to have

4109
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:57,990
also the color of the sound I think
it's nice to have a more soothing

4110
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,190
it's nice to have a more soothing
warmer

4111
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:58,750
it's nice to have a more soothing
warmer color

4112
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,060
it's nice to have a more soothing
warmer color So if

4113
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,320
it's nice to have a more soothing
warmer color So if you

00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:00,850
warmer color so if you want to go a
little

4118
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,280
warmer color so if you want to go a
little bit

4119
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,660

little bit more into the Sultan
Sultan to color

4124
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:04,790
little bit more into the Sultan
Sultan to color and you obviously

4125
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,900
Sultan to color and you obviously
have

4126
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,410
Sultan to color and you obviously
have to move

4127
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,050
Sultan to color and you obviously
have to move your hand a

4128
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:06,370
Sultan to color and you obviously
have to move your hand a little bit

4129
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:06,560
have to move your hand a little bit
this

4130
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,690
have to move your hand a little bit
this way

4131
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,330
have to move your hand a little bit
this way to the left it's

4132
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:08,820
have to move your hand a little bit
this way to the left it's nice to

4133
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,110
have to move your hand a little bit
this way to the left it's nice to do

4134
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:09,310
this way to the left it's nice to do
that because

4135
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:09,470
this way to the left it's nice to do
that because the

4136
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:09,890
this way to the left It's nice to do
that because the sound

4137
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,400
it's nice to do that because the
sound is so much warmer.

4138
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,220
I

4139
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:16,650
I supposed

4140
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,230
I supposed to

4141
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:17,390
I supposed to playing

4142
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,860
I supposed to playing it here

4143
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,320
I supposed to playing it here so

4144
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,990
I supposed to playing it here so
just play with

4145
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,560
I supposed to playing it here so
just play with it a

4146
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,820
I supposed to playing it here so
just play with it a little

4147
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,160
I supposed to playing it here so
just play with it a little bit

4148
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,330
I supposed to playing it here so
just play with it a little bit and

4149
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:22,910
just play with it a little bit and
see what

4150
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:23,330
just play with it a little bit and
see what you

4151
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:23,530
just play with it a little bit and
see what you like and

4152
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:23,770
just play with it a little bit and
see what you like and what sounds

4153
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:23,910
see what you like and what sounds
good

4154
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,680
just play with it a little bit and
see what you and what sounds good to

4155
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,880
see what you and what sounds good to
your

4156
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,260
see what you and what sounds good to
your ear but I

4157
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:27,370
see what you and what sounds good to
your ear but I don't

4158
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:27,480
see what you and what sounds good to
your ear but I don't know

4159
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:27,880
see what you and what sounds good to
your ear but I don't know it could

4160
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,260
your ear but I don't know it could
be

4161
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,750
your ear but I don't know it could
be a good

4162
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,070
your ear but I don't know it could
be a good exercise

4163
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:29,380
your ear but I don't know it could
be a good exercise to

4164
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:29,380
your ear but I don't know it could
be a good exercise to explore your

4165
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,530
be a good exercise to explore your
sounds

4166
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:31,770
be a good exercise to explore your
sounds and different

4167
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,250
be a good exercise to explore your
sounds and different hand

4168
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:33,650
be a good exercise to explore your
sounds and different hand positions

4169
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,070
sounds and different hand positions
You don't

4170
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,600
sounds and different hand positions
You don't need to

4171
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:34,970
sounds and different hand positions
you don't need to move

4172
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,130
hand positions. You don't need to
move the hand too much.

4173
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,210
move the hand too much.
Here and there

4174
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:37,640
move the hand too much.
Here and there but

4175
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,090
move the hand too much.
Here and there but just

4176
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:38,340
Here and there but just if you
decide

4177
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,330
Here and there but just if you
decide to place 2

4178
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:39,700
Here and there But just if you
decide to place 2000 I think you

4179
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:39,700
decide to place 2000 I think you
should stay

4180
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,380
I think you should stay in saltado
throughout the.

4181
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,080
Throughout the

4182
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,300
Throughout the entire

4183
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:44,670
Throughout the entire section

4184
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:44,850
Throughout the entire section that

4185
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:45,320
Throughout the entire section that
we talked

4186
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,000
we talked that we're talking about
here and

4187
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,500
we talked there were talking about
here and we have this.

4188
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,860
The

4189
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,360
The slower so that

4190
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,800
The slower so that has

4191
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,150
The slower so that has to

4192
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,980
The slower so that has to be

4193
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,090
The slower so that has to be clear

4194
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:54,370
The slower so that has to be clear
as well

4195
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:54,630
The slower so that has to be clear
as well You don't have

4196
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,890
The slower so that has to be clear
as well You don't have to

4197
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,460
The slower so that has to be clear
as well You don't have to rush it

4198
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:56,750
as well You don't have to rush it
you can

4199
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,320
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play

4200
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,310
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play it

4201
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,210
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play it slower

4202
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,680
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play it slower this

4203
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,260
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play it slower This is

4204
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,950
as well You don't have to rush it
you can play it slower This is bar

4205
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,230
you can play it slower. This is bar
6468.

4206
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,360
Then 72 and

4207
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,580
Then 72 and 6076 so.

4208
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,890
Then 72 and 6076 so.
Whenever you have

4209
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:09,580
Then 72 and 6076 so.
Whenever you have a

4210
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,060
Then 72 and 6076 so.
Whenever you have a slower we have

4211
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,770
Whenever you have a slower we have a
tendency to

4212
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,070
Whenever you have a slower we have a
tendency to play it

4213
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:11,810
Whenever you have a slower we have a
tendency to play it a

4214
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,010
Whenever you have a slower we have a
tendency to play it a little bit

4215
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:13,250
tendency to play it a little bit too
fast

4216
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:13,610
tendency to play it a little bit too
fast so no

4217
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,090
tendency to play it a little bit too
fast so no need to do

4218
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,800
tendency to play it a little bit too
fast so no need to do it just play

4219
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,190
fast so no need to do it just play
it a little

4220
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,180
fast so no need to do it just play
it a little bit

4221
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,330
fast so no need to do it just play
it a little bit slower you

4222
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,110
fast so no need to do it Just play
it a little bit slower you can use

4223
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,270
it a little bit slower You can use
Roboto

4224
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:20,890
it a little bit slower You can use
Roboto but I

4225
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,980
You can use Roboto,
but I wouldn't suggest too much.

4226
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,560
but I wouldn't suggest too much.
Again

4227

So the next section 79 to 91 again
the here.

4328
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,550
We have

4329
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,250
We have again this

4330
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:56,490
We have again this beautiful

4331
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:56,920
We have again this beautiful melody

4332
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,430
We have again this beautiful melody
in the

4333
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,860
We have again this beautiful melody
in the upper

4334
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,160
We have again this beautiful melody
in the upper voice

4335
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,750
We have again this beautiful melody
in the upper voice especially so

4336
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:00,260
in the upper voice especially so
it's

4337
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:00,840
in the upper voice especially so
it's important

4338
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,060
in the upper voice especially so
it's important to

4339
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,340
in the upper voice especially so
it's important to emphasize

4340
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,550
in the upper voice especially so
it's important to emphasize that

4341
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:01,960
it's important to emphasize that as
well

4342
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,150
it's important to emphasize that as
well But

4343
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,420
it's important to emphasize that as
well but it's

4344
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,650
it's important to emphasize that as
well but it's also

4345
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:02,920
it's important to emphasize that as
well but it's also important

4346
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,810
it's important to emphasize that as
well but it's also important to

4347
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,230
it's important to emphasize that as
well but it's also important to keep

4348
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,310
well but it's also important to keep
the base

4349
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:06,550
well but it's also important to keep
the base steady

4350
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:06,970
the base steady and emphasized as
well

4351
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,470
the base steady and emphasized as
well So

4352
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,100
the base steady and emphasized as
well so you kind

4353
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,540
the base steady and emphasized as
well so you kind of have to

4354
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:08,540
the base steady and emphasized as
well So you kind of have to do

4355
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,960
the base steady and emphasized as
well so you kind of have to do both

4356
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,840
well so you kind of have to do both
sometimes

4357
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,680
well so you kind of have to do both
Sometimes it's

4358
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:12,960
well so you kind of have to do both
Sometimes it's good

4359
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,400
Sometimes it's good to practice the
practice

4360
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,910
Sometimes it's good to practice the
practice voices

4361
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,210
Sometimes it's good to practice the
practice voices separately

4362
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,980
Sometimes it's good to practice the
practice voices separately so that

4363
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,320
practice voices separately so that
you hear

4364
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,710
practice voices separately so that
you hear a

4365
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,530
practice voices separately so that
you hear a little bit more

4366
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:17,930
practice voices separately so that
you hear a little bit more what's

4367
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:17,940
you hear a little bit more what's
happening in the

4368
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,270
you hear a little bit more what's
happening in the different

4369
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,220
you hear a little bit more what's
happening in the different voicings

4370
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:19,490
happening in the different voicings
by

4371
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:19,900
happening in the different voicings
by just

4372
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,230
happening in the different voicings
by just make sure

4373
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,580
happening in the different voicings
by just make sure that

4374
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,820
different voicings by just make sure
that we hear that bass.

4375
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,140
You

4376
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,950
This

4377
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,300
This beautiful

4378
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:25,900
This beautiful and then

4379
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,240
This beautiful and then in

4380
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,610
This beautiful and then in the bars
82.

4381
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,580
And

4382
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,720
And take your time here.

4383
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,750
I think

4384
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,170
I think you

4385
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,370
I think you can

4386
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:42,380
I think you can start a

4387
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:42,890
I think you can start a little bit
softer and then

4388
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:43,820
I think you can start a little bit
softer and then just

4389
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,370
I think you can start a little bit
softer and then just have

4390
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,010
I think you can start a little bit
softer and then just have a

4391
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,270
softer and then just have a very
gradual

4392
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,570
softer and then just have a very
gradual crescendo towards and then.

4393
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,390
I always like

4394
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:51,520
I always like to

4395
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,270
I always like to emphasize this base.

4396
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,340
Before you go here.

4397
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:03,560

4399
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,510
This just gives you a

4400
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,160
This just gives you a chance

4433
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:23,960
as you don't have abrupt changes in
dynamics just very

4434
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,140

dynamics Just very very gradual

4436
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,970
as you don't have abrupt changes in
dynamics just very very gradual and

4437
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,880
dynamics Just very very gradual and
not

4438
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,120
dynamics Just very very gradual and
not too harsh

4439
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,750
dynamics just very very gradual and
not too harsh So and then

4440
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,920
dynamics just very very gradual and
not too harsh So and then we

4441
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,360
dynamics just very very gradual and
not too harsh So and then we go

4442
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:28,830
dynamics just very very gradual and
not too harsh So and then we go to

not too harsh So and then we go to
the

4444
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,370
not too harsh So and then we go to
the bar 80

4445
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:30,670
not too harsh So and then we go to
the bar 87

4446
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,060
not too harsh So and then we go to
the bar 87 this is

4447
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,180
not too harsh So and then we go to
the bar 87 This is my

4448
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,750
not too harsh So and then we go to
the bar 87 This is my favorite

4449
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,990
and then we go to the bar 87. This
is my favorite part in this.

it's important to bring that out but

4462
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:45,030
it's important to bring that out but
in

4463

it's important to bring that out but
in a

4464
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,680
it's important to bring that out but
in a bar 80

4465
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,020
it's important to bring that out but
in a bar 87

4466
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,210
it's important to bring that out but
in a bar 87 make

4467
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:46,670
it's important to bring that out but
in a bar 87 make sure

4468
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,200
it's important to bring that out but
in a bar 87 make sure you

4469
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,890
but in a bar 87 make sure you start
strong so.

4470
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,140
And then

4471
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,630
And then just

4472
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:55,950
And then just continue

4473
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,380
And then just continue into

4474
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,950
And then just continue into the

4475
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,420
And then just continue into the bars
9

4476
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,330
And then just continue into the bars
980

4477
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,250
And then just continue into the bars
989

4478
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,380
And then just continue into the bars

4481
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,290
And then just continue into the bars

4482
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:04,820
And then just continue into the bars
9809909192 so again

4483
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,130
980-990-9192. So again,
thanks very strong.

4484
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,200
Again my

4485
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,950
Again my suggestion would

4486
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,480
Again my suggestion would be

4487
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,560
Again my suggestion would be to
practice

4488
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,010
Again my suggestion would be to
practice the

4489
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:12,860
Again my suggestion would be to
practice the practice it separately

4490
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,350
practice the practice it separately
You don't have to

4491
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:13,440
practice the Practice it separately
You don't have to practice

4492
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,050
the to practice it separately. You
don't have to practice it together.

4493
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:19,870
And then

4494
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,080
And then bar

4495
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,740
And then bar 90

4496
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,490
And then bar 90 excuse

4497
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,790
And then bar 90, excuse me,
91 again.

4498
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,810
Then

4499
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,060
Then you

4500
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,510
Then you have this beautiful

4501
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,530
Then you have this beautiful line
line

4502
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,040
Then you have this beautiful line
line as well

4503
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,310
Then you have this beautiful line
line as well which

4504
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:30,630
Then you have this beautiful line
line as well which is important

4505
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,960
line as well,
which is important to bring it out.

4506
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,820
My suggestion would

4507
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,340
My suggestion would be to

4508
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,670
My suggestion would be to play

4509
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,450
My suggestion would be to play rest
stroke here

4510
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,680
My suggestion would be to play rest
stroke Here it's just

4511
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:42,930
My suggestion would be to play rest
stroke here It's just easier

4512
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,420
My suggestion would be to play rest
stroke here It's just easier to

4513
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:44,660
stroke Here it's just easier to
emphasize the line

4514
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,030
stroke Here it's just easier to
emphasize the line and

4515
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,240
stroke Here it's just easier to
emphasize the line and to

4516
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,980
emphasize the line and to control
the

4517
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,240
emphasize the line and to control
the sound

4518
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,430
emphasize the line and to control
the sound a

4519
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,900
emphasize the line and to control
the sound a little

4520
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,340
emphasize the line and to control
the sound a little bit better

4521
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:48,490
emphasize the line and to control
the sound a little bit better but

4522
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:48,690
the sound a little bit better but
again

4523
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,070
the sound a little bit better but
again it's

4524
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,320
the sound a little bit better but
again it's up

4525
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,530
the sound a little bit better but
again it's up to

4526
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:49,970
the sound a little bit better But
again it's up to you and

4527
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,260
the sound a little bit better But
again it's up to you and make

4528
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,660
it's up to you and make sure we hear
this.

4529
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,380
Very

4530
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,380
Very clearly in

4531
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:57,650
Very clearly in the

4532
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:57,970
Very clearly in the bars

4533
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:58,040
Very clearly in the bars 93

4534
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,010
Very clearly in the bars 9394.

4535
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,290
Very clearly in the bars 9394.
And

4536
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:00,790
Very clearly in the bars 9394.
And again on

00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,420
Very clearly in the bars 9394.
And again on time I'm taking

4539
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,240
Very clearly in the bars 9394.
And again on time I'm taking some

4540
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,590
And again on time I'm taking some
liberties here as I'm

4541
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:02,880
And again on time I'm taking some
liberties here as I'm not

4542
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,590
And again on time I'm taking some
liberties here as I'm not really

4543

liberties here as I'm not really
playing in

4544
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,450
liberties here as I'm not really
playing in time but again

play in time You can later on when
you when you start playing this

4566
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,240
later on when you when you start
playing this piece

4567
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,020
you when you start playing this
piece you can

4568
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,230
you when you start playing this
piece you can take

4569
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:17,420
you when you start playing this
piece you can take more

4570
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:17,780
you when you start playing this
piece you can take more liberties

4571
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,010
piece you can take more liberties
but

4572
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,290
piece you can take more liberties
but when you're practicing it

4573
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:18,800
piece you can take more liberties
but when you're practicing it just

4574
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,030
but when you're practicing it just
make sure

4575
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,020
just make sure you're playing in
time.

4576
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,660
And

4577
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,100
And then

4578
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,670
And then again bar 90

4579
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:24,930
And then again bar 96

4580
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,410
And then again bar 96 we have the
same.

4581
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,600
In

4582
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,760
In the

4583
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,750
In the base line

4584
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,070
In the base line again

4585
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:32,520
In the base line again make

4586
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:32,920
In the base line again make sure

4587
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,430
In the base line Again make sure you

4588
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,350
In the base line again make sure you
emphasize

4589
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,620
In the base line again make sure you
emphasize that as

4590
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:36,790
In the base line Again make sure you
emphasize that as well

4591
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:36,980
In the base line again make sure you
emphasize that as well So again

4592
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,350
emphasize that as well So again you
so you

4593
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:37,710
emphasize that as well So again you
so you have

4594
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,020
emphasize that as well So again you
so you have all

4595
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,270
so you have all these different
voices that

4596
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,090
so you have all these different
voices that is

4597
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,030
so you have all these different
voices that is really

4598
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,570
so you have all these different
voices That is really important

4599
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:43,350
voices that is really important to
explore here and.

4600
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,850
Just.

4601
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:45,760
Just.

00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,480
Take you I would I would say it's
very free

4607
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:47,840
Take you I would I would say it's

4608
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,050
Take you I would I would say it's
very free here So take

4609
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,220
Take you I would I would say it's
very free here So take your

4610
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,110
very free here so take your
liberties

4611
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:49,700
very free here so take your
liberties with this

4612
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,150
very free here So take your
liberties with this with this

4613
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,620
liberties with this with this part
of

4614
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,560
liberties with this with this part
of the

4615
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,240
liberties with this with this part
of the piece

4616
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,390
liberties with this with this part
of the piece bar

4617
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,660
with this part of the piece bar,
it's 100.

4618
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,270
This is where

4619
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,990
This is where it gets

4620
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,510
This is where it gets a

4621
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:03,190
This is where it gets a little bit
more

4622
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,440
This is where it gets a little bit
more difficult

4623
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,240
This is where it gets a little bit
more difficult because we

4624
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,830
This is where it gets a little bit
more difficult because we have more

4625
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,670
more difficult because we have more
cords.

4626
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,480
cords.
And

4627
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,660
cords.
And so I think.

4628
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,540
And so I think.
Again

4629
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:11,930
And so I think.
Again practicing

4630
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:12,280
And so I think.
Again practicing separately

4631
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,700
Again practicing separately would be
helpful so

4632
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,210
practicing separately would be
helpful, so just do it.

4633
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,240
Just so you can

4634
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:21,520
Just so you can hear

4635
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:21,970
Just so you can hear a

4636
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:22,510
Just so you can hear a little

4637
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,450
Just so you can hear a little bit
better what's happening.

4638
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,970
better what's happening.
And

4639
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,500
better what's happening.
And then practice

4640
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,600
better what's happening.
And then practice the base

4641
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,140
And then practice the base
separately

4642
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,510
And then practice the base
separately as well

4643
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,940
And then practice the base
separately as well and

4644
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,460
separately as well and then put it
together.

4645
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,440
Make

4646
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,080
Make sure you

4647
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,040
Make sure you don't

4648
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,340
Make sure you don't arpeggiate

4649
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,980
Make sure you don't arpeggiate
unnecessarily here I

4650
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,470
unnecessarily Here I would suggest
you to

4651
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:35,520
unnecessarily here I would suggest
you to play the

4652
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,360
unnecessarily here I would suggest
you to play the courts

4653
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,840
unnecessarily here. I would suggest
you to play the courts together so.

4654
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,360
I

4655
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,020
I repeated this one

4656
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,080
I repeated this one because I

4657
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,780
I repeated this one because I think

4658
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,150
I repeated this one because I think
it's

4659
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:43,530
I repeated this one because I think
it's one of

4660
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:43,600
I repeated this one because I think
it's one of them You can

4661
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,630
I repeated this one because I think
it's one of them you can arpeggiate

4662
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:44,810
it's one of them you can arpeggiate
It's nice

4663
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:45,080
it's one of them you can arpeggiate
it's nice to

4664
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,440
it's one of them you can arpeggiate
It's nice to do it

4665
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:45,580
it's one of them You can arpeggiate
it's nice to do it but

4666
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,100
it's one of them You can arpeggiate
it's nice to do it but not

4667
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,740
it's one of them You can arpeggiate
it's nice to do it but not all

4668
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,140
it's nice to do it but not all of
them

4669
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,650
it's nice to do it but not all of
them so

4670
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,100
but not all of them so you can start
together.

4671
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,790
And

4672
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,200
And then make sure you

4673
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,770
And then make sure you play

4674
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,380
And then make sure you play these
together.

4675
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,000
And then?

4676
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,190
And then?
Killer

4677
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,550
And then?
Killer pagedale 1.

4678
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,900
And

4679
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,310
And then

4680
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,660
And then you have this melody.

4681
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,750
This is

4682
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,240
This is also

4683
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,390
This is also very

00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,790
in bar 1/4.
To

4701
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:23,910
wouldn't There's no really There is
no rules like I said before if you

4702
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,300
no rules Like I said before if you
just

4703
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,000
no rules Like I said before if you
just look at it visually you

4704
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,550
no rules Like I said before if you
just look at it visually you can

4705
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:26,770
just look at it visually you can
just follow

4706
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,840
just look at it visually you can
just follow that

4707
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,230
just look at it visually you can
just follow that and when you

4708
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:29,890
just look at it visually you can
just follow that and when you have

4709
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,960
just follow that and when you have
the notes going up you can

4710
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,500
just follow that and when you have
the notes going up you can just

4711
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,090
just follow that and when you have
the notes going up you can just do a

4712
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:32,710
the notes going up you can just do a
simply

4713
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,240
the notes going up you can just do a
simply crescendo and then

4714
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,880
simply crescendo and then the notes
are going

4715
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,190
simply crescendo and then the notes
are going down you can

4716
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:34,950
simply crescendo and then the notes
are going down you can do a

4717
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,590
are going down you can do a
decrescendo

4718
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:35,730
are going down you can do a
decrescendo So

4719
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,120
are going down you can do a
decrescendo So just follow the

4720
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,020
decrescendo So just follow the
natural

4721
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,450
decrescendo So just follow the
natural line but

4722
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:39,960
decrescendo so just follow the
natural line but here the most

4723
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,580
natural line But here the most
important thing is to

4724
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:40,940
natural line But here the most
important thing is to have

4725
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,600
natural line But here the most
important thing is to have a

4726
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,560
important thing is to have a
consistent sound

4727
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:42,890
important thing is to have a
consistent sound so you

4728
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:43,150
important thing is to have a
consistent sound so you don't you

4729
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:43,640
consistent sound So you don't you
don't

4730
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,140
consistent sound So you don't you
don't want to you don't want

00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,310
Away from you is as we

00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
Away from you is as we say So you

00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:54,960
wanna still have this consistent
beautiful

4741

4746
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,510
and even if you need to emphasize
certain notes.

4747
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,880
Try

4748
00:59:59,880 --> 00:59:59,990
Try not

4749
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,470
Try not for

4750
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:01,020
Try not for it to sound

4751
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:01,160
Try not for it to sound too

4752
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,670
Try not for it to sound too harsh

4753
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:01,990
Try not for it to sound too harsh So
it's

4754
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,410
Try not for it to sound too harsh so
it's just

4755
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:02,880
Try not for it to sound too harsh so
it's just keep the

4756
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,570
Try not for it to sound too harsh so
it's just keep the consistent sound

4757
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,260
it's just keep the consistent sound
throughout

4758
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:05,390
it's just keep the consistent sound
throughout the

4759
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:05,740
it's just keep the consistent sound
throughout the entire

4760
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:05,810
throughout the entire section in the
bar

4761
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,680
throughout the entire section in the
bar one

4762
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,830
sound throughout the entire section
in the bar 17.

4763
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,830
Again the

4764
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,160
Again the baseline is

4765
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,630
Again the baseline is it's

4766
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,190
Again, the baseline is,
it's really important. And then.

4767
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,080
110

4768
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,690
1:10 and 1:11.

4769
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,050
This

4770
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,910
This is the last time.

4771
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:25,880
This is the last time.
Before

4772
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,320
This is the last time.
Before we

4773
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,480
This is the last time.
Before we go

4774
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:26,890
This is the last time.
Before we go into

4775
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:27,100
This is the last time.
Before we go into the

4776
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:27,360
This is the last time.
Before we go into the triplets

4777
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,920
This is the last time.
Before we go into the triplets in

4778
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,990
Before we go into the triplets in
bar 112.

4779
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,400
So

4780
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:31,670
So I

4781
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:31,970
So I think

4782
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,050
So I think that's

4783
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:34,410
So I think that's about

4784
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:35,270
So I think that's about it depending

4785
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,790
So I think that's about it depending
on

4786
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,340
depending on which transcription you
use.

4787
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,060
There's some.

4788
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:39,590
There's some.
Some

4789
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,420
There's some.
Some they're different so

4790
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:42,800
There's some.
Some they're different so there's

4791
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:42,880
Some they're different so there's
some additional additional

4792
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,490
Some they're different so there's
some additional additional notes

4793
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,300
some additional additional notes in
different

4794
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,720
additional notes in different
descriptions, but.

4795
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,740
descriptions, but.
And again it's as

4796
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,430
descriptions, but.
And again it's as I said in

4797
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:48,750
And again it's as I said in the
beginning it's

4798
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,150
And again it's as I said in the
beginning it's completely

4799
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:49,350
And again it's as I said in the
beginning it's completely up to

4800
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:49,930
beginning it's completely up to you
which

4801
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:50,720
beginning it's completely up to you
which description

4802
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,730
beginning it's completely up to you
which description you

4803
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:52,980
beginning it's completely up to you
which description you decide

4804
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,270
beginning it's completely up to you
which description you decide to use

4805
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,600
which description you decide to use
so

4806
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:53,850
which description you decide to use
So let's

4807
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,110
which description you decide to use
So let's go

4808
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:54,230
which description you decide to use
So let's go to bar

4809
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,810
which description you decide to use
So let's go to bar one

4810
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,850
description you decide to use. So
let's go to bar 1112.

4811
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:56,810
Where

4812
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,540
Where we

4813
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,690
Where we have

4814
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,110
Where we have the

4815
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:00,480
Where we have the triplets

4816
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,400
Where we have the triplets again

4817
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,470
Where we have the triplets again and

4818
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,010
Where we have the triplets again and
we

4819
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:02,680
Where we have the triplets again and
we have this

4820
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,180
we have this baseline that is
extremely

4821
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,110
we have this baseline that is
extremely important

4822
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,490
we have this baseline that is
extremely important here, so we go.

4823
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:18,200
And then we end

4824
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:18,520
And then we end here

4825
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:18,680
And then we end here in

4826
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,220
And then we end here in the

4827
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:19,240
And then we end here in the bar

4828
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:19,470
And then we end here in the bar one

4829
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:19,850
And then we end here in the bar 115

4830
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,330
And then we end here in the bar 115
so I'll talk a

4831
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:20,880
And then we end here in the bar 115
So I'll talk a little bit

4832
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,190
And then we end here in the bar 115
so I'll talk a little bit about

4833

So I'll talk a little bit about that
section from 112

4837
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,550
So I'll talk a little bit about that
section from 1122115.

4838
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,420
So we talked

4839

So we talked about this in a

4842
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,180
So we talked about this in the A
section

4843
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,660
So we talked about this in the A
section the importance of

4844
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:29,720
So we talked about this in the A
section the importance of practicing

4845
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,040
the importance of practicing it
slowly again.

4846
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,660
And

4847
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,280
And making

And making sure that we hear the

4850
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,260
And making sure that we hear the
triplets

4851
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:36,600
And making sure that we hear the
triplets very

4852
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,200
triplets very,
very articulated well.

4853
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,780
And

4854
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:39,910
And keeping

4855
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,730
And keeping that

4856
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:43,690
And keeping that baseline nice and
steady.

4857
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,290
You're

4858
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:55,680
You're going

4859
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:55,740
You're going to

4860
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,370
You're going to have to extend the

4861
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:56,880
You're going to have to extend the
elbow

4862
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,830
You're going to have to extend the
elbow a

4863
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,480
You're going to have to extend the
elbow a little bit

4864
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,010
You're going to have to extend the
elbow a little bit here because

4865
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,170
You're going to have to extend the
elbow a little bit here because you

4866
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,530
elbow a little bit here,
because have you have to press.

4867
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,370
The

4868
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:02,600
The 4th

4869
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:02,900
The fourth finger

4870
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,480
The fourth finger on the

4871
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:03,600
The fourth finger on the 6th string
here

4872
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,630
The fourth finger on the 6th string
here at the end

4873
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,410
The fourth finger on the 6th string
here at the end so just

4874
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:06,520
The fourth finger on the 6th string
here at the end So just extend

4875
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,050
here at the end,
so just extend it a little bit.

4876
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,400
so just extend it a little bit.
And

4877
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:09,680
so just extend it a little bit.
And again

4878
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,290
so just extend it a little bit.
And again don't

4879
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:10,670
so just extend it a little bit.
And again don't press too hard

4880
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,260
And again don't press too hard
That's kind

4881

And again don't press too hard
That's kind of a general rule

4884
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,930
And again don't press too hard
That's kind of a general rule in

4885
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,120
That's kind of a general rule in
this

4886
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,220
That's kind of a general rule in
this space

4887
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:13,980
That's kind of a general rule in
this space not

4888
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,420
That's kind of a general rule in
this space not to press too

4889

01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,870
For the right hand as well so if you
want to do that

4901
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,320
you want to do that,
that's definitely helpful.

4902
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,730
And

4903
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,460
And I

4904
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:48,540
And I believe

4905
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,430
And I believe there's different

4906
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:50,840
And I believe there's different
versions

4907
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,110
And I believe there's different
versions again

4908
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:51,300
And I believe there's different
versions again and

4909
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:51,770
versions again and different
fingerings

4910
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:51,930
versions again and different
fingerings that

4911
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,430
versions again and different
fingerings that you can use

4912
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,260
different fingerings that you can
use. I just put the bar.

4913
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,280
But if

4914
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:02,530
But if that

4915
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:02,710
But if that doesn't work

4916
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:03,910
But if that doesn't work there's

4917
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,560
But if that doesn't work there's
other ways to

4918
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,980
But if that doesn't work there's
other ways to do this

4919
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:06,150
But if that doesn't work there's
other ways to do this as

4920
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,260
But if that doesn't work there's
other ways to do this as well I mean

4921
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:06,700
other ways to do this as well I mean
you

4922
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,040
other ways to do this as well I mean
you could

4923
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,390
other ways to do this as well I mean
you could start

4924
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,900
this as well. I mean you could start
with an open string.

4925
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,680
So again

4926
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,490
So again just and

4927
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:15,900
So again just and then there's
different

4928
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,200
So again just and then there's
different versions

4929
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:16,590
So again just and then there's
different versions so

4930
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,810
different versions so whichever one
you use

4931
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,260
different versions so whichever one
you use just

4932
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,860
different versions so whichever one
you use just make

4933
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,430
different versions So whichever one
you use just make sure that

4934
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,960
you use just make sure that baseline
is very

4935
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,370
you use just make sure that baseline
is very very

4936
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:20,700
you use just make sure that baseline
is very very consistent

4937
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,500
is very very consistent throughout
the

4938
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,320
is very very consistent throughout
the entire section

4939
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:23,490
is very very consistent throughout
the entire section and then

4940
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:23,840
is very very consistent throughout
the entire section and then the last

4941
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,020

couple of couple of bars from 11

4946
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,590
couple of couple of bars from 115
till the end.

4947
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:29,770
The

4948
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,030
The last

4949
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,940

4950
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,780
The last is again

4951
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,180

the B section so

4957
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,220

the B section so we have

4958
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:37,800
The last is again the main melody of
the B section so we have to

4959
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,840
melody of the B section,
so we have to keep the octaves.

4960
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,960
so we have to keep the octaves.
Beautifully

5255
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:51,850
And you can read your Dando into bar
132 so 130

5256
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,150
And you can read your Dando into bar
132 so 132 to the end

5257
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,540
And you can read your Dando into bar
132 so 132 to the end is

5258
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,500
And you can read your Dando into bar
132 so 132 to the end is the

5259
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,990
And you can read your Dando into bar
132 so 132 to the end is the last

5260
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,270
132 so 132 to the end is the last
last

5261
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:56,630
132 so 132 to the end is the last
last section so again there

5262
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,860
132 so 132 to the end is the last
last section so again there could

5263
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,460
132 so 132 to the end is the last
last section so again there could be

5264
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:57,730
last section So again there could be
a

5265
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,610
last section so again there could be
a contrast

5266
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:58,910
last section So again there could be
a contrast here

5267
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,440
there could be a contrast here in
132.

5268
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,810
Till the end you

5269
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:03,090
Till the end you can play

5270
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:03,550
Till the end you can play it

5271
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:03,900
Till the end you can play it a

5272
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,330
Till the end you can play it a
little bit

5273
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:04,700
Till the end you can play it a
little bit louder

5274
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,360
Till the end you can play it a
little bit louder not

5275
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:07,820
Till the end you can play it a
little bit louder not too

5276
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:07,960
Till the end you can play it a
little bit louder not too much

5277
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,680
little bit louder not too much so
again

5278
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,740
little bit louder not too much So
again try

5279
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,710
little bit louder not too much So
again try to emphasize

5280
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,900
little bit louder not too much So
again try to emphasize that

5281
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,690
again try to emphasize that baseline
that

5282
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,200
again try to emphasize that baseline
that we had

5283
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,440
again try to emphasize that baseline
that we had in

5284
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,870
try to emphasize that baseline that
we had in the beginning as well.

5285
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,850
The same here.

5286
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,250
Yeah

5287
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:26,860
I think

5288
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,490
I think that's

5289
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:27,730
Yeah I think that's very

5290
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,170
Yeah I think that's very important

5291
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:28,700
Yeah I think that's very important
here

5292
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,380
Yeah I think that's very important
here so

5293
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:29,860
Yeah I think that's very important
here So there's

5294
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,490
Yeah I think that's very important
here So there's different

5295
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,250
here So there's different versions
of this

5296
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:31,500
here So there's different versions
of this ending

5297
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:31,700
here So there's different versions
of this ending I

5298
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,580
this ending I just played. Very
simple.

5299
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,580
And then?

5300
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,310
I didn't

5301
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:47,760
I did to

5302
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,420
I did to really emphasize the

5303
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,480
I did to really emphasize the last
chord so that

5304
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:50,640
I did to really emphasize the last
chord so that there

5305
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,030
I did to really emphasize the last
chord so that there is a

5306
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,290
I did to really emphasize the last
chord so that there is a little bit

5307
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:51,680
chord so that there is a little bit
of

5308
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,690
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast

5309
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:55,770
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again

5310
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:56,270
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again between

5311
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:56,520
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again between one

5312
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,680
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again between 130

5313
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,360
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again between 136

5314
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,100
chord so that there is a little bit
of contrast again between 136 and

5315
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,290
of contrast again between 136 and
100

5316
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:00,890
of contrast again between 136 and
137

5317
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,560
of contrast again between 136 and
137 So discord

5318
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,010
of contrast again between 136 and
137 So discord harmonics

5319
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:03,220
of contrast again between 136 and
137 So discord harmonics and

5320
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:03,400
137 So discord harmonics and then
the

5321
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,760
1:37. So discord, harmonics,
and then the last court.

5322
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:05,830
It

5323
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,170
It could even

5324
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,450
It could even be

5325
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:07,720
It could even be ponticello it

5326
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,020
It could even be ponticello It
doesn't have to

5327
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,500
It could even be ponticello It
doesn't have to be it's

5328
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:09,860
It could even be ponticello It
doesn't have to be it's just

5329
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:10,700
doesn't have to be It's just it's
nice

5330
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,070
doesn't have to be It's just it's
nice to end again

nice to end again with

5332
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:11,760
doesn't have to be it's just it's
nice to end again with a little

5333
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,270
doesn't have to be it's just it's

more presence but

5336
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,580
nice to end again with a little bit
more presence but it's up to you

5337
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,270
more presence but it's up to you

more presence but it's up to you
Could even

more presence but it's up to you
could even end in

5341
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:17,550
more presence but it's up to you
could even end in a softer and

5342
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,900
could even end in a softer and
warmer

5343
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,640
could even end in a softer and
warmer color

5344

could even end in a softer and
warmer color but again

could even end in a softer and
warmer color But again personally

5346
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:20,670
warmer color But again personally
it's just I

5347
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,090

warmer color But again personally
it's just I prefer a

5349
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,530
